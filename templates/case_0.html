BROWNLIE solicitor of the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia, appeared for the second respondent/wife M and TheDirector of the Department of Community Services (W.A.) Appeal No.257/1985 Judgment delivered: 7th July 1986 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FAMILY LAW - CHILDREN - SEXUAL ABUSE - Application for care and protectionunder State law - whether federal jurisdiction of FamilyCourt of Western Australia excluded - Access application by father convicted of offence - Intervention by Director - Weight to be given to objection by Director - Family Law Act 1975, s.10(1) - Child Welfare Act 1947 (WA) ss 6, 29, 30,92 The husband had been convicted on three counts of improperly and indecentlydealing with a child of the marriage. An application wasmade by the Director tohave the two children of the marriage declared to be in need of care andprotection under s.30 of the Child Welfare Act 1947 (WA). That application wasadjourned by the magistrate for 12 months pending which the children remained inthe care of the mother. The husband sought access to the children which the Director opposed excepton strict conditions as to supervision under the controland observation of hisofficers. The husband refused to accept these conditions and applied to theFamily Court of Western Australiafor access. The Director opposed those termsand intervened in the proceedings seeking an adjournment pending the disposal oftheproceedings before the magistrate. The learned trial judge dismissed theapplication and made the orders as between the parents byconsent. The Directorappealed. HELD: by Joske, Butler & Nygh JJ The Family Court of Western Australia had federal jurisdiction - (a) because the children were still in the care and control of the mother,and (b) applications for access were not excluded by s.10(1) in any event. The learned trial judge had not erred in exercising his discretion to assumejurisdiction: Kitchener and Kitchener (1977-78) 34 FLR 453,explained. However, the trial judge did err in purporting to make orders by consent whenthe Director did not consent and had raised seriousobjections to the terms onwhich access had been consented to by the mother. The issues raised by theDirector should have been heardand determined by the trial judge. Orders set aside and matter remitted for re-hearing. Decision isreportable. JOSKE, BUTLER & NYGH JJ: This is an appeal from orders made byhis Honour Judge Ferrier of the Family Court of Western Australia defining theconditions underwhich the husband is to have access to the children of themarriage: MA, born January 1973, and MJ, born July 1978. The parties were married on 22nd July 1972 and co-habited until August 1985.On 16th April 1985 the husband was convicted in theCourt of Petty SessionsPerth on three counts of improperly and indecently dealing with the child MArelating to incidents whichtook place between October1984 and March 1985. Hepleaded guilty to all counts and was sentenced to two years probation. Thehusband has since been undergoing a course of psychiatric counselling conductedby Dr. L. In early August 1985 the child MJ madean allegation to the policeabout indecent behaviour by her father in her presence which was alleged to havetaken place at the sametime as the earlier incidents. At this time, the partiesfinally separated, the children remaining with the wife. It seems that no charges were laid in respect of MJ's allegations but on 19thAugust 1985 a Mr. J, a senior social worker employedby the Director-General ofthe Department for Community Services (W.A.) made two care and protectionapplications pursuant to s.30 of the Child Welfare Act 1947 (W.A.), to have bothchildren of the marriage declared to be children in need of care and protection.That application came on forhearing at the Perth Children's Court on 8thOctober 1985 when the matter was adjourned to 12th August 1986. The learnedmagistratedirected that the children remain with the mother and furtherrecommended that: "Access be granted to the father provided he continues with psychological or family counselling. Such access by [the husband] to be on the basis of supervised visiting. This supervision beby a person with whom the children have a close and warm relationship". Following the adjournment, the solicitor for the husband contacted thedepartmental officer in charge of the case, Ms. V, with a viewto arrangingsupervised access. A case conference was held on 25th October 1985 at thepremises of the Children's Protection Servicewhich was attended by [thehusband] and his solicitor. A dispute, evolved as to how access should bere-established. The husbandproposed that access be exercised at the home of hisparents, where he was now residing, and under their supervision. Ms. V preferredto proceed more gradually by first arranging access in the special observationroom of the Children's Protection Service. She alsodid not consider thehusband's parents to be suitable supervisors having doubts about their capacityto do so and the closeness oftheir relationship with the children. Attempts byMs. V to discuss those matters with the grandparents were rebuffed by them. [Thehusband] was not prepared to accept the observed access offered by theDepartment. On 1st November 1985 the husband made application to the Family Court ofWestern Australia under the Family Law Act 1975 for orders for defined access tobe supervised by his parents. Affidavits in support of the application werefiled by the husband,by his parents stating their willingness to exercisesupervision and by Dr. L stating his view that the offences were the productofa unique period of extreme stress and turmoil and not the result of a specificsexual orientation. Hence he stated in his viewthat the offences are "mostunlikely to occur again". The Department obtained leave to intervene in the proceedings under s.92 ofthe Family Law Act and resisted the application by the husband seeking itsadjournment sine die. At the hearing on 12th November 1985 each of the parties were represented aswas the Department. His Honour ordered that the partiesattend counselling. On15th November 1985 the matter was back before Ferrier J. Counsel for the husbandannounced that the husbandand wife had agreed on terms of access. Indeed itappears from the wife's evidence at transcript p.18 that the husband had beenroundto see the children under her supervision. However, the Departmentcontinued its objections. Mr. McKenna then appearing for the Department conceded that the Court hadjurisdiction but argued that the circumstances of the casewere such that theCourt, in its discretion, should decline to exercise it. His Honour proceeded to exercise the powers of the Court to call of itsmotion evidence from the mother as to the welfare of the children.[The wife]was sworn and examined by his Honour. She was thereafter cross-examined by Mr.McKenna. No other witnesses were calledor examined. At the conclusion of thehearing Mr. McKenna made further submissions opposing the exercise ofjurisdiction by the Courtin the matter. In his short judgment, the learned trial judge said at pages 8 and 9 of theappeal book: "It is common ground between all the parties that it is in the interests of the welfare of the children that the husband in theseproceedings have access to them. To my way of thinking, the personsclosest to the children in terms of being able to interpret andanticipate their wishes and their needs would be the mother and thefather, and finally the Intervener, in that order. The mother is confident that there would be no repetition of the behaviour of the father that led to actions being taken by theIntervener. She is not so absolutely confident that she does not wishto have some safeguard in that respect, but she considers thesafeguard is there and can be measured in terms of the contact whichshe, we will say, puts forward as being best for the children asbetween their father and themselves and that is during daylight hourson weekends, or for the most part daylight hours; that it be in thehome of, or more in the supervision of, at least one of the husband'sparents or his sister. At least as relates to the parents she doesbelieve and she testifies to a very good relationship existing. Finally, she has it in mind that should there be any reversion in the behaviour of the father towards at least the elder child, thechild would report the same to her and she would take appropriate steps in this Court to cancel any contact or to very much more limitcontact between the father and the children. I consider that the mother has not in any way abnegated her responsibilities to the children; nor does she wish to do so; and Ido not think that her responsibilities towards the children shouldnecessarily be supervised by a State instrumentality". He then dismissed the application of the Intervener, concluding with thewords at page 10 of the appeal book: "On the husband's application, by consent, there will be orders in terms of the minute". The terms of that minute as incorporated in his Honour's orders were asfollows: "BY CONSENT: (a) The husband have reasonable access to the said children defined to include (i) each Thursday between the hours of 6.30 pm and 9.30 pm (ii) every other weekend from 9.00 am to 9.00 pm on Saturday and from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm on Sunday (iii) on intervening Saturdays between the hours of 9.30 am and 12.30 pm. Access aforesaid be supervised by either of the parents of the husband or byhis sister MRS. W." It is from these orders that the Department now appeals. Seven grounds ofappeal were listed. The first ground, as presented to thisCourt by Mr. Foulshamon behalf of the Department, can best be summarized as: (a) That the Family Court of Western Australia in the exercise of itsfederal jurisdiction could not exercise jurisdiction inthis matter by reasonof the provisions of s.10(1) of the Family Law Act, or in the alternative, (b) That if the Court did have jurisdiction it should in the exercise ofits discretion have refused to exercise it. Section 10(1) of the Family Law Act 1975 provides as follows: "10(1) Subject to sub-section (3), a Court shall not make an order under Part VII or Part VIII for the maintenance, custody, orguardianship of - (a) a child who, under the law of a State, is a ward of the state or a state child or is under the guardianship, or the careand control, of - (i) a Minister of the Crown of the State; (ii) an officer of the State; or (iii) an officer of an adoption agency approved under the law of the State; or (b) a child who has a similar status under a law of a Territory". It was conceded that sub-section (3) was not relevant in the presentproceedings. It was argued that the children had, by reason of the proceedings initiatedby the Department, become children who are under the careand control of anofficer of the State of Western Australia, to wit, the Director of theDepartment for Community Welfare. It wasargued that this situation wasachieved, despite the fact that the children had remained in the care of themother throughout, bythe operation of s.29 of the Child Welfare Act 1947.Section 29, insofar as relevant, provides: "s.29. (1) Any officer of the Department authorized by theMinister and any police officer may, without warrant, apprehend anychild appearing or suspected to be in need of care and protection or tobe an uncontrolled child. (2) When any such child is apprehended, pending the hearing ofthe application, charge or information, or during any adjournment ofthe hearing or during any period of remand the child shall be-- (a) taken to his place of residence and there left,upon the recognisance of a near relative for his appearance; (b) placed with some respectable person and sucharrangement or agreement may be made as may be necessary or properfor the care and maintenance of that child; or (c) taken to and placed in any Departmental centre orDepartmental facility of an appropriate kind, or such othersuitable place as is approved by the Director. (3) Where any child is apprehended in any of the circumstancesdescribed in subsection (1) of this section or subsection (1) ofsection thirty-eight of this Act, he shall, as soon as is practicable,be brought before the court to be dealt with according tolaw." It can be accepted that if a child is apprehended, the powers of placementunder sub-section (2) are exercised by the Director byvirtue of s.6 of the Actand that thereby pending the determination of the application under s.30, thechild is in the care and control of the Director whether or not eventually acommittal or placement order is made under s.30(1) of the Act. In this regardthe Western Australian legislation bears a strong resemblance to the provisionsof s.22(4) of the Social Welfare Act 1970 (Vic) considered by Asche J. inKitchener and Kitchener (No. 2) (1977/8) 34 FLR 453, and differs from theprovisions of s.82(1) of the Child Welfare Act 1939 (NSW) considered by thisCourt in Sargent and The Director of the Department of Youth and CommunityServices (NSW), (1986) FLC 91-718. However, before this situation is reached, the child must have beenapprehended under s.92. It is true, as Mr. Foulsham pointed out,thatapprehension or arrest can be effected without physical contact by the personbeing apprehended obeying a verbal command. Buteven so, evidence is lacking inthis case of any apprehension. It may be open to infer from the copies of the application attached to Ms.V's affidavit in which the words "child, father, mother"appear and have notbeen crossed out, that the children were present in court. But the applicationonly refers to a summons addressedto the mother to attend court on a particularday. Even if a similar direction had been given in respect of the children, thisisnot necessarily an apprehension. Otherwise every summons or subpoenacommanding a person to attend would constitute an arrest orapprehension. It would have been different of course if a Departmental officer had come andtaken the children to the court, but there is no evidenceof that. The statementmade by Mr. McKenna from the bar table at transcript 32 that it was the practiceof the Department to apprehendchildren in such cases and that he understoodfrom Mr. J that he did in fact apprehend the children, is hardly admissibleevidenceof that fact. Nor is there any evidence of any placement of the children with the mother. It was conceded that the learned magistrate did not havethe power to place thechildren under s.29(2)(b): That was clearly a matter for the Department. Inthose circumstances it is difficultto see how his Honour could have beensatisfied on the evidence that the children were at the relevant time under thecare and controlof the Director. Even if those hurdles could be overcome and the children, upon theirapprehension, came within the care and control of the Director,there is thefurther problem that the making of access orders in respect of such childrendoes not appear to be excluded by s.10.Section 10(1) provides that the Court"shall not make an order under Part VII or Part VIII for the maintenance,custody or guardianship"etc. No reference to access occurs in sharp contrast towhat appears in paragraphs (cb), (cc), (ce) of the definition of "matrimonialcause" in s.4(1) and in ss. 64(1), 64(1B), 64(2), 68(3) and 68(4). This makes itdifficult, if not impossible, to argue that thewords "custody or guardianship"in s.10(1) should be read as if they included a reference to access. It was argued that notwithstanding this difficulty s.10(1) should be read asif it included a reference to access having regard tothe decision of the HighCourt in R v Lambert, ex p Plummer [1980] HCA 52; (1980) 6 Fam. L.R. 355. However, onour reading that case offers no support for that proposition. The view of themajority of the High Court in that casewas that the Family Court could not beauthorised to make an order for custody which was enforceable against theDirector of ChildWelfare or similar official in respect of a child actuallycommitted to the care and control of such official. As the Full Court heldin In the Marriage of Pobke (1985) 10 Fam. L.R. 408, a similarrestriction applies in respect of an order for access to a child who has beencommitted to theactual care and control of a Director. As all the Justices inthe High Court agreed there is no constitutional restriction on thejurisdictionof the Family Court to make an order for custody, and a fortiori for access, ofa state ward which is enforceable asbetween the parents of such child: seeGibbs J, as he then was, at 359. In the present case this is all that wasdone and the jurisdiction of the court to do so cannot be doubted. What wouldhappen if onthe evidence the children had actually been apprehended and theDirector, in the exercise of his ultimate control, actually forbadethe wife togive access to the husband is not a matter which we have to consider here. Next it was argued that the learned trial judge in the exercise of hisundoubted discretion should have adjourned the proceedingsuntil the proceedingsin the Children's Court had been completed. That course was followed by BarblettJ. in the unreported caseZamani and Zamani, Family Court of WesternAustralia, October 1981. Strong reliance was also placed on the remarks by AscheJ. in In the Marriage of Kitchener at 458, 459: "It would be productive of the greatest difficulty and embarrassment if orders made under State Acts werecountermanded by orders made under the Family Law Act and s.10 isdesigned, so far as possible, to avert that situation. It seemsto me for that reason there is little distinction to be drawn between the situation where an application is made but not yet heard to have a child declared in need of care andprotection and the actual declaration that a child is in need ofcare and protection. In either case the state has assumedjurisdiction properly open to it under the State Act and the same evils would follow if this Court were to cut across the operation of the State Act whether it be at the early stageof the actual application without the hearing or after thehearing and determination. In either case, the confusion whichwould result by two possible contrary orders is what s.10 is designed to prevent or at least control." As the Full Court in Sargent's case pointed out, those remarks must beread in the light of the facts of that case. In that "case the children had beenplaced inthe actual care and control of a state institution pending thedetermination of the application for a protection order. There wereapplicationsbefore the Family Court by each of the parties seeking the custody of thechildren. Asche J. at 464 adjourned theproceedings until the magistrate haddealt with the application under the Social Welfare Act. He indicated that hewould probably order that the wife have the custody if the magistrate wereto adjourn the proceedings on conditions which permitted the wife "to have defacto custody of the childrenor care and control of them". That of course isthe situation in the present case, and consequently the decision, far fromsupportingthe Director-General's case, actually supports the course followed bythe learned trial judge. For that reason we cannot find thathis Honour erred inthe exercise of his discretion on that issue. The second ground of appeal alleges that the court purported to make an orderby consent when the appellant did not consent. Thisrefers to the order whichthe learned trial judge made on 12th November 1985 when he directed that theparties attend a confidentialconference under s.62(1) of the Act, with leave tothe intervener to attend if he saw fit. This is not quite the same as orderingthe intervener to attend as the ground of appeal states. Having found that hisHonour had jurisdiction to deal with the matter, andacted within the properscope of his discretion to assume jurisdiction, it must follow that his Honour'sdecision to refer the partiesto a conference with a court counsellor cannot bequeried. The third ground is that his Honour purported to make an order by consentwhen the Department clearly did not consent. This refersto the fact that order5 of the orders made by his Honour, as engrossed, is headed with the words "Byconsent". The approach takenby his Honour is shown in the last two sentences ofhis judgment at pages 9 and 10 where he says: "In the circumstances, sofar as the application of theintervener amounts to a dismissal of the husband's application foraccess, that application of the intervener is dismissed. On thehusband's application, by consent, there will be orders in terms ofthe minute". His Honour therefore appears to have treated the application by theDepartment as an objection to the exercise of the jurisdictionof the Court andonce he had dismissed that objection, he seems to have taken the view that theintervener in effect had been removedfrom the proceedings. This left only theparents as the effective relevant parties and they had consented to orders. With respect to his Honour this was not the correct approach. Having grantedleave to the Director-General to intervene under s.92of the Act, theDirector-General became entitled to all the rights and obligations of a party tothe proceedings. It was entitledto a consideration not only of itsjurisdictional objections but also the substantive issues raised in theaffidavit of Ms. V. Themost substantive issue raised in that affidavit was therefusal of the paternal grandparents with whom the father resides to discusswith the Department their role as supervisors, and the refusal by the fatherhimself to co-operate with the Department. There wasalso the fact testified by[the wife] at transcript pages 12 and 13 that there was not a very goodrelationship between her and thepaternal grandparents and not a warm and lovingrelationship between the grandparents and the children. There was also theevidenceof Ms. V that [the husband] had contacted her on several occasions totry and convince her that MJ had not been abused by him andthe somewhat strangeevidence of the wife at pages 19 and 20 of the transcript of her acceptance bothof the initial allegation byMJ and her subsequent retraction. There was noevidence before his Honour at all about Mrs. W, the alternative supervisor. These were basic concerns for the welfare of the children which his Honourcould not dismiss as he did at page 8 of his judgment bysimply ranking theability to interpret the welfare of the children as mother, father and theDepartment in that order. Ground 5 of the appeal states that the Court failed to take proper steps toascertain the wishes of the children. As the decisionof the Full Court inJoannou and Joannou (1985) FLC 91-642 indicates, the wishes of thechildren, however young, must be taken into account. In the view we have taken,it is not necessaryto decide whether in this case his Honour erred in failingto order a Family Report or otherwise ascertain the wishes of the children. Ground 6 of the appeal states that the Court failed to satisfy itself thatthe people who are to supervise access are suitable personsand able to protectthe children. This ground has already been dealt with and in our view his Honourerred in this regard. Havingregard to the nature of the allegations of sexualabuse and the husband's admission of them, there was in our view a positiveobligationon his Honour to be satisfied that adequate arrangements had beenmade to ensure that such conduct did not re-occur. There was an issue raisedin the allegations by Ms. V as to the suitability of the paternal grandparentsand therewas no evidence at all concerning Mrs. W. His Honour made no findingsas to these issues trusting them in effect to the mother'sjudgment. This was ofcourse the result of his Honour's assumption that the mother and even the fatherwas a better judge of thewelfare of the children than the Department. Havingregard to the expertise available to the Department and its obligation toprotectthe welfare of children in the State, this is a somewhat boldassumption. Ground 7 of the appeal states: "7. The Judge failed to regard the welfare of the children as the paramount consideration in that: (i) he ordered defined access; he does not give the child an opportunity to refuse access; he failed to take into account theseriousness of the offences of indecentdealing committed by the father against thechild MA; he failed to take into consideration thepressure put on the child MJ by the husband to retract statements she had made about sexual abuse by her father the first respondent". So far as (i) is concerned, this ground is somewhat difficult to understand.One would have thought that in a case such as this anorder for defined accesswas appropriate. So far as (ii) is concerned, it is not generally desirable to give a child aright of veto over particular instances of access, certainlynot children aged12 and 7 who are liable to a multiplicity of parental pressures. So far as (iii) and (iv) are concerned, we have already dealt with them. HisHonour should certainly have taken into account the seriousnessof the offencesof indecent dealing of which the husband had been convicted and he should havetaken into account the allegationsof the pressure put on the child MJ toretract her allegation of sexual abuse in considering whether the arrangementsagreed to bythe mother were adequate. For those reasons we have come to the conclusion that his Honour erred in theexercise of his jurisdiction and that consequently theorders should be setaside and the matter remitted to a single judge of the Family Court of WesternAustralia.

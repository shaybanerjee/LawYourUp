<h1> LawYourUp </h1> 

The application takes a court case (.txt) file as input and finds similar court cases in the past by comparing the semantics of words found in documents using a DOC2VEC algorithm.

<p> Participated at AI for social good, a hackathon organized by TD Bank in Montreal, where I met a lawyer and a seasoned Java developer. The lawyer had the idea of building an application that would make it easier for lawyers to perform comparative analysis when observing court cases. The idea was to lessen the time, cost, and work lawyers have to do to find legal precedent. </p> 

<b> The application was build using the following technlogies: </b>
 - Python <br>
 - Java <br>
 - JavaScript <br>
 - Html <br>
 - CSS <br><br>
 
 <h3> Setup </h3> 
 <ul>
  <li> Download Pycharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ </li> 
  <li> Run ModelMaker.py on the sample court cases or use the Crawler to fetch court cases</li> 
  <li> Run ModelUser.py on the model that is trained and created by ModelMaker.py</li> 
  <li> Use WebApp to input a court case and find similar court cases from the past </li> 
</ul>

FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA AT NEWCASTLE FILE NUMBER:NCC1279 of 2012 Mr Kerby Applicant And Ms Kerby Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT INTRODUCTION Theseare competing applications for adjustment of interests in matrimonial property. The applicant is the husband, aged 43. Therespondent is the wife, aged 42. The parties began living together in early 1992 and married the following year. There were twochildren born of their marriage, one of whom is a young adult. The other child is now aged 11 years. Parenting arrangements havebeen made forhim by the resolution of that part of the proceedings by consent orders. Thechild lives with his mother and spendstime with his father. InMarch 2011 the parties separated after a 19 year relationship. Husband becomes self-representing Atthe commencement of the hearing the husband was represented by solicitor andcounsel, as was the wife. There were some discussionsin an attempt to resolvethe matter on the first day. The matter was unable to be resolved. Therefollowed an application by solicitor and counsel for the husband to withdraw. That application was granted. The husband thereafterrepresented himself. He didnot wish to apply to adjourn the proceedings but to continue to determination. THE APPLICATIONS Thehusband filed an Initiating application on 17 May 2012. By the time of thefinal hearing, he relied on a Third Amended InitiatingApplication filed 6September 2013.[1] Thewife relied on her Response filed 3 July 2012 and the Minute of Order handed upduring the final hearing.[2] SHORT HISTORY OF EVENTS RELEVANT TO THE ADJUSTMENT OF PROPERTYINTERESTS In1994 the parties purchased a property in Suburb H in joint names for $117,000. The parties borrowed the whole of the funds forthe purchase. After thepurchase of the property the wife returned to work and her mother assisted theparties by caring for theirchild, then less than one year old. In1998 the parties paid contractors to renovate their home at a cost of about$90,000 to $100,000. In1999 the older child started school and the wife obtained work at that schoolduring school hours. In2002 the parties purchased investment properties. The husband bought a propertyin Suburb L (the Suburb L property)in his sole name for $200,000.The wife purchased a property in Suburb M (the Suburb M property)in her sole name for$200,000. InMarch 2003 the parties second child was born and the wife took 18 monthsmaternity leave from work. Also in that year,the wife was diagnosed with amental illness, namely Bipolar Disorder. In2004 the parties borrowed $100,000 to start a business, Business J (thebusiness) operated by a company of the samename. Both parties wereshareholders. InNovember 2006 the wife experienced an episode of mental illness and was treatedin hospital. She then commenced consultation witha psychiatrist. In2008 the parties undertook further renovation to the home and property. In thatyear also the wife was again admitted to hospital. In2009 the younger child commenced school. In2010 the parties purchased shares on their own behalf and for the wifesmother for $16,000. InMarch 2011 the parties separated. The husband moved out of the matrimonialhome, first living with his sister and then in privaterental accommodationlocally. On13 April 2011 some NAB shares were sold for $8,680. InMay 2011 the husband sold the Suburb L property for $282,000. From the saleproceeds $210,000 was used to discharge the mortgageon the property and thebalance was used to reduce the mortgage on the Suburb H property (theproperty). Inmid-2011 the wife sold the Suburb M property for $350,000. The net proceedswere used to pay out the mortgage secured on thatproperty, approximately$220,000 and the balance was used to repay debts. On14 October 2011 the wifes employment in the family company wasterminated. InOctober 2011 the husband sold a further parcel of shares. InNovember 2011 the wife discovered that her visa card had been cancelled by thehusband. InJanuary 2012 the husband formed a new relationship with his current partner. In2012 the wife withdrew $9,000 from the mortgageaccount on the property whichshe paid to her mother as the return on shares in which her mother had investedwith the parties. InJanuary 2012 the wife found that the account for her telephone had beencancelled by the husband and all information on it subsequentlylost. On3 February 2012 the husband removed certain items from the property. He tooksteps to cause the company to issue further sharessuch that the husbandthereafter had control of the company, whereas previously there were 20 ordinaryshares, 19 of which were ownedby the wife and one by the husband. After theshare issue the position became 119 ordinary shares, 19 of which were owned bythewife and 100 by the husband. The husband issued a fuel card and telephoneto his new partner. On8 February 2012 the wife withdrew $49,000 from the mortgage account and soonafter moved out of the matrimonial home. She setsout with particularity howthose funds were used.[3] I acceptthat the monies were used for removal fees, legal costs, expenses for thechildren and otherwise living expenses. Inlate February to early March 2012, after the wife and the younger child movedout of the matrimonial home, the husband and hisnew partner moved into it. Thehusband alleged, and the wife denied, that there was damage to the propertycaused by her. On17 May 2012 these proceedings were commenced. THE EVIDENCE Theparties relied on the following documents: Husband: ThirdAmended Initiating Application filed 06/09/2013; Affidavitof husband filed 06/09/2013; Affidavitof husband filed 04/07/2014; Documenttitled Third Amended Financial Statement filed 04/07/2014; Affidavitof Ms E filed 06/09/2013; Wife: Responseto Initiating Application filed 03/07/2012; Affidavitof wife filed 11/09/2013; Affidavitof wife filed 12/06/2014; SecondAmended Financial Statement of wife filed 12/06/2014; Affidavitof Dr F filed 11/09/2013; Affidavitof Ms G filed 11/09/2013; Affidavitof Mr K filed 20/09/2013; and Affidavitof Single Expert witness Ms N filed 05/11/2012. ORAL EVIDENCE THE HUSBAND Thehusband was somewhat agitated throughout his cross-examination. He had notexpected to be unrepresented. Further he had cometo understand that despitehis personal views about that matter, he was bound by the joint valuation of thebusiness operated bythe family company. By the conclusion of the hearing heappeared to understand that his approach to preparation had been unhelpfultohim. Hewas not inclined to make concessions about the wifes role as primarycaregiver for the two children. The husband commentedon the fact that the wifewas not in paid employment, for a lot of years. Her life was going tothe gym. Likewisein relation to the Suburb M investment property purchased by the wife, he wasreluctant to concede the work done by the wifeand her mother towards conversionof that property into two flats. Inrelation to the parties younger child, the husband did not agree that hehad failed to take the opportunity to spend allthe time he could have with him.He did concede that he had not spent more than one week with the child in theChristmas school holidays2011 and 2012. Theparties agree that the husband made the financial decisions during the marriage.His evidence suggested that the husband had foundthe transition to separationdifficult. He did not consult with the wife or give notice before cancelling hervisa card. He withdrewthe balance of funds from a joint account, after thewife had withdrawn some of those funds. The car used by the wife, but ownedbythe family company, was allowed to become unregistered. Theexplanation for arranging to have the wifes mobile telephone blocked soas to be unusable was that the wife was not allowinghim to see or talk to theiryounger child. He conceded that the issuing of the additional shares was toregain control and preventthe wife from having access to company funds. Itis clear to me that in 2011, the wife struggled to support herself and theparties younger child. I accept that she wasineligible for Governmentbenefits because of her assets and income through the company. Her credit cardwas withdrawn for a periodof time; she was also without a telephone. Thesefactors contributed to her decision to move out of the family home to live withher parents. I accepted as an explanation of the wife that her decision towithdraw $49,000 in February 2012 was a pragmatic one,done in order to meet thenecessary expenses of herself and the child. Thehusband conceded that post-separation, he had control over the assets of thecompany, the sale of shares and joint bank accounts. Thehusband agreed with the proposition that interest in superannuation should besplit equally and an order has been made by consenton that basis. The husbands partner Thehusbands partner was not required for cross-examination, no doubt becauseher affidavit related mainly to parenting matters. Sheis aged 35 and has been living with the husband in the former matrimonial homeof the parties for about two and a half years.She has two children aged 12 and11, whose care is shared between herself and the childrens father. Sheis in fulltime employment as a consultant. Her average weekly income disclosedby the husband is $550 per week. THE WIFE Thewife is living in the Hunter area with her parents and the younger child. Shehas had a new partner since about October 2012. InMarch 2014, after the sale of his own home, her partner moved in to live withher in her parents home. This is a shortterm measure. The wife isplanning to live with her partner and the younger child in the home that he hasalready purchased forthem. He has two children; one of them who is an olderteenager and will be an occasional member of that household. Thewife has paid board to her parents, but at the time of trial, was alsocontributing to household expenses by buying groceriesand other householditems, averaging at a value of about $230 per week. Since he has been a memberof the household, her partnerhas also contributed to the household by payingboard. Thewife works on a permanent part-time basis, two to three days per week, in aretail role locally. She states, and there is nobasis for not accepting, thatthe prescribed medication she takes for her mental illness makes her tired andunable to work fulltime. She has worked at the level stated above through thesupport of her parents doing the cooking, cleaning and domestic work for herselfand the child. Thewife readily made concessions when she was cross-examined by the husband. Inparticular that the husband had looked after thefinances throughout therelationship and had made the investment decisions, including the decision topurchase the two investmentproperties. Thewife was asked by the husband why she had moved with their younger child to livewith her parents. I accept the answer she gave,which was, I had nosupport, no money, no child care. The evidence supports that propositionfor the position of thewife in early 2012. Whenasked what she had done to contribute to the business operated by the familycompany, the wife answered in a considered way,that she had done the banking,entered all the goods into the records, done the filing, physically moved thegoods around and hadcarried out checks on the goods. Theevidence of the wife in her affidavit was not successfully challenged. The wifes partner Thewifes partner presently pays about $400 a week to the contribution of thehousehold of the wifes parents, with whomhe is living, until theproperty he purchased for himself, the wife, her younger child and his twochildren as and when they needto stay with him is ready. He is in fulltimeemployment as a tradesman. Although he was not a member of the wifeshouseholdat the time she filed her amended financial statement, he was includedin that document as an income earner of gross $2,500 per week. The wifes mother Thewifes mother was asked only one question, no doubt because the majorityof her affidavit related to parenting issues. That question related to theamount of board that was paid by the wife and her partner. The answer she gavewas consistent withthe evidence of the wife and her partner on thattopic. The wifes doctor Thewifes doctor was not required for cross-examination. She had provided amedical report.[4] The reportattested to the wife having received appropriate medical assistance from herselfand the psychiatrist she consults andthat her illness is well controlled,allowing her to gain employment and to care for her son. APPROACH TO ALTERATION OF INTERESTS IN PROPERTY Inconsidering applications for alteration of property interests and transfer ofproperty the Court must: (i) Identifythe existing legal and equitable interests of the parties inproperty;[5] (ii) Considerwhether it would be just and equitable in the particular circumstances to makean alteration; and (iii) If analteration should be made, to consider the matters contained in s 79(4) ands 75(2) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) (the Act) incoming to an adjustment; and (iv) Analyseand consider whether the adjustment under consideration would be just andequitable. (i) Identify the assets and liabilities of the parties Theinterests in property assets and liabilities of the parties were identified in ajoint Balance Sheet[6] as set outbelow: Oship Description Wifes value Hband value ASSETS 1 J [C Street, Suburb H] $570,000.00 $570,000.00 2 J [Business J] $267,498.00 222,197.00 Total $837,498.00 $792,197.00 ADDBACKS 3 W Monies wife withdrew from mortgage on 02.02.2012 See Note $49,000.00 4 H Monies retained by husband from Joint NAB account ...67 on31.01.12 See Note ($18,700) 5 H Austpac Resources shares sold mid 2012 See Note ($1,520) Total $49,000.00 LIABILITIES 6 J NAB Mortgage ...44 $78,376.00 $78,376.24 7 J NAB Mortgage ...76 $50,637.00 $50,637.21 8 J NAB Mortgage ...59 [Should be 56] $99,999.00 $99,999.00 9 H Commonwealth Mastercard See Note $16,039.01 10 W Estimated Taxation Liability re: CGT on sale of [I] Street, [SuburbM] $24,024.00 $24,024.00 11 W Loan to pay legal fees $118,367.00 Total $371,072.00 $269,075.46 SUPERANNUATION Member Name of Fund Type of Interest Wifes value Hband value 12 W [B] Super Accumulation $38,887.00 $38,887.00 13 W [O] Super Accumulation $3,656.00 $3,656.00 14 H [B] Super Accumulation TBA $99,136.67 Total $ $144,379.67 Notes Item 2. Husbands Contention The valuation is at least two years of ageand the businesses Financial Statements provided show there has been a loss of$108,111.11over the past three finances years, as follows: Financial yearending 30 June 2014 loss of $73,413.79; Financial yearending 30 June 2013 profit of $3,481; Financial yearending 30 June 2012 loss of $38,178.38 The loss is as a result ofa general downturn trend that is occurring in the ... industry as a whole and wepoint to in particular[Business P] who have ceased trading and the general ...industry as evidenced by the closure of the [Company Q] and [Company R]factories. The second hand wholesale market has been superseded by extremelyaffordable new [goods] being imported from overseas. The value of thebusiness must be reduced by the fees paid to the Single Expert for the valuationreport ($10,000), the fee paid tothe company accountant ($4,301) and thegoodwill attributed to the business by the valuer ($31,000). The Goodwillshould not beincluded as part of the valuation as the business is a Sole Traderand a Wholesaler Business, Goodwill should not be attached. Expert Valuationof business $267,498 LESS Valuers fees of $10,000 LESS Accountants Fees of$4,301 LESS Goodwill $31,000 Total: $222,197 WifesContention: The Wife relies upon the Single Experts report of Ms. [N]dated 1 November 2012 as to the value of the Company and associatedassets. (SeeReport [Ms N] Page 4, Para 2.3) The Husband has not asked questions of theSingle Expert in relation to the value of the Company. Neither party hassought to instruct the Single Expert to update the valuation of the Company. 3. Husbands Contention: These are monies the Wife drew down on theMortgage and retained following separation. WifesContention: Having regard to the decisions in Stanford [2012] HCA 52 andBevan [2013] FamCAFC 116 the Wife submits that it is no longer appropriate foraddbacks to be dealt with as balance sheet matters. 4-5 Wifes Contention: As above, the Wife contends thataddbacks should not be treated as a balance sheet item. However, for the purpose of identifying the issue, the Wife contends thatpost separation, the Husband withdrew funds from the nominatedjoint account andsold shares. 9 Wifes contention: The Husband has produced no statements inrelation to this account other than an account summary showing balance @ 7 June2014 of$15,697. The Wife does not conceede that the liability should be takeninto account. Analysis Item2: The value of item 2 was fairly and properly conceded by the wife to requirededuction of the value of the vehicle transferredto her by the company andretained by her. An adjustment down, as advised, has been made. Item3: I am satisfied that the monies withdrawn from the mortgage account by thewife were used for legitimate personal and familyexpenses at a time when thewife had no other source of income. Items4 & 5: Likewise, the amounts in these items have not been added back. Thehusband had some expenses associated with separationboth for himself and thewife. Thepresent interests of each of the parties are: The wife: (a) The wife has a motor vehicle transferred by the company and her interest insuperannuation. She has a significant debt to herparents in relation to legalfees and an estimated capital gains tax liability for the sale of the Suburb Minvestment property. The husband: (b) The husband has occupation of the former matrimonial home, the company, thebusiness that the company runs and his interestsin superannuation. He has amaster card debt, but there were no statements produced to support that creditcard liability untilthe second day of this hearing, the position taken by thewife was that the debt was thereby established, although late, but therewas noconcession of it being a joint liability.

Theparties two main assets, the former matrimonial home and the company which runsthe business operated during the marriage, arejointly owned assets. Themarriage has come to an end; the parties have re-partnered. There was arelevant relationship for 19 years, during which twochildren were born to theparties and assets were generated. Itis appropriate to consider an adjustment to the interests to recognise theseparation and for each party to have access to theirlegitimateinterests. (iii) Consideration of contributions of each of the parties andof adjustments pursuant to Section 75(2) factors Initial Contributions Thehusband owned some furniture and personal effects. He also had some minorpersonal debts. Thewife had a motor vehicle which she says was a two year old Mitsubishi worthabout $23,000, and which the husband asserted to beworth approximately $9,000. There is no basis for choosing between those asserted values and given that themarriage endured foralmost 20 years, there is no particular significance to thedifference. Contributions during the relationship Thehusband worked fulltime, long hours, weekdays and sometimes weekends. Hisevidence suggests that it was a matter for regret laterin life that he hadworked in that way, with the consequence of spending little time with thechildren, particularly his older child. His wages earned were applied to thebenefit of the family by way of loan repayments, rates and bills, holidays andother familyexpenses. In2004 the parties commenced the business run by a company in which they were bothshareholders. Thehusband worked fulltime in that business. I am satisfied that the wife alsoworked in that business to the extent consistentwith her care of the twochildren. Duringthe relationship, the parties acquired either two or three investment propertiesand renovations and improvements were undertaken;the Suburb M investmentproperty was divided into two flats. The husband did physical work includingsanding, painting and othergeneral maintenance tasks. The wife and her motheralso did some physical work, including painting and soft furnishings. Thehusband attended to maintenance of the goods sold by the business and assistedat times with domestic work. Thewife worked in the business and in paid employment, after periods of maternityleave, longer with the second child. There wereperiods of ill health where shewas unable to work. To the welfare of the family Itis not disputed that the wife was the primary homemaker and parent to theparties two children. No matter how lovinglyundertaken, that task wasmade more onerous by the husbands tendency to work up to 11 days perfortnight for long hours. Supervision of the childrens education andextracurricular activities was largely undertaken by her. Analysis Thiswas a long marriage. Both parties worked hard; the husband more focused on moredirect financial contribution; the wife morefocused on a contribution to thecare of the children and the domestic work of the household. They applied theirincome and labourto the benefit of the family. Atthe conclusion of the relationship in 2011, their contributions should beconsidered equal. Post-separationthe wife withdrew $49,000 from the mortgage account. This provided her with thefinance she needed to support herselfand the child. Accordingly, there need beno further adjustment in relation to the period of separation. (iii) Relevant s 75(2) factors for adjustment Ofthe factors to be taken into consideration, I note the following. Age and state of health Thehusband is 43 and in good health. Thewife is 42; her health is well managed by medication and appropriateconsultation with a psychiatrist. An effect of her medicationis fatigue, whichreduces her capacity to work. She has been working two to three days per weekand may work less when she beginsliving fulltime with her current partner andthe younger child. Part of the reason for that is that she expects to beattendingto domestic work in the household, which has been undertaken by herparents post-separation, releasing her to paid employment. Income property and financial resources Thehusbands sole source of income is from the business. He has run thatbusiness with some assistance from the wife for thelast 10 years. His currentpartner is paid a wage by him, as has been the case since that relationshipbegan. Theassumed earnings of the husband, $87,200 per annum, are drawn from the valuationreport.[7] It may be the case thatthey are not the actual earnings of the husband at this time. However there isno basis for finding thathis capacity to earn at that level is reduced. Thewife is earning approximately $350 per week, or $18,200 per annum, with littlelikelihood that she will earn more in the futuregiven two restrictions on hercapacity to work; the effect of prescribed medication and her need to continueto be present and supervisethe younger child around school hours andholidays. Commitments of each of the parties necessary to enable theparty to support him or herself Thehusband supports himself by way of his income and provides some support to hispartner. His assertion that he provides some financialsupport to the twochildren of his partner[8] is not amatter that I take into account as having priority over the need to makeprovision for the wife. It is a reflection ofthe fact that the husband is ableto provide that support to his new partner and her children. Thewife supports herself by way of her income and has been supported financially byher family by way of loans for legal costs andassistance with domestic tasksand supervision of the younger child. Superannuation/Government Benefits Neitherparty receives a pension allowance or benefit. Each of them has an interest insuperannuation, which will be adjusted byconsent. Each will then haveapproximately $70,000 in superannuation. There will be least 20 years beforeeither party can accessthose funds through retirement. A standard of living in all the circumstances that isreasonable Thehusband wished to retain the home and make a payment to the wife; however heacknowledged the necessity of the house being soldin the circumstances. Thewife seeks the sale of the property. In any event, both parties recognise thata cash adjustment is requiredto meet the wifes interest and given thatthe husband has been primarily responsibility for conducting the business thatitshould stay with him. Duration of the marriage Theparties cohabitated for a total of 19 years and there has been a period of aboutthree and a half years of separation. Where either party is cohabitating Thehusband has lived with his partner since January 2012. She is employed andcontributes her income to household bills and thefinancial support of herselfand her two children, who are regular part-time members of that household. Thewife is presently living with her partner in the home of her parents, but willundoubtedly soon be living with her partner, togetherwith the younger child andoccasionally the late teenage and early adult daughters of her partner. He willcontribute his incometo household bills, general expenses and the financialsupport of himself and, to some extent by the provision of a house, thewife. Child support Thehusband pays and will likely continue to pay child support asassessed. (iv) Is the adjustment of interests under consideration justand equitable Takingthese factors into account I consider there should be an adjustment in favour ofthe wife, with particular reference to herrestricted capacity for paidemployment and her obligation for at least the next seven years, to provide mostof the care and supervisionfor the younger child. That adjustment shouldcreate a ratio of 60/40 in favour of the wife. Accordinglythe parties shall each retain the following: (a) The wife wouldretain: 1. Proceeds of sale of C Street $570,000 Less payment of mortgages $229,012 and estimated sale costs $ 20,000 $249,012 $320,988 2. Superannuation $ 70,840 $391,828 Less Capital Gains Tax $ 24,024 $367,804 Less payment of loans $118,000 $249,804 (b) The husband wouldretain: 1. Business J $234,713 2. Superannuation $ 70,840 $305,553 Husband will pay personal debts $ 16,514 $289,039 Thehusband will have the income from his business, superannuation benefits and bedebt free. Thewife will have a cash sum towards accommodation, superannuation benefits and bedebt free. Iam satisfied that the adjustment of interests is just and equitable for thereasons stated. SUPERANNUATION Therewas an agreement between the parties that interests in superannuation would besplit in such a way as to share equally. Theagreed figure for the base amountwas $29,000. However,I have found that there was an error in the addition of Items 12 to 14 inclusive(the three funds). Accordingly,the total of $141,680 requires a base amount of $28,297 to be allocated to thewife. (a) Wife: Item 12 $38,887 Item 13 $ 3,656 $42,543 Plus allocated amount $28,297 $70,840 (b) Husband: Item 14 $99,137 Less allocated amount $28,297 $70,840 I certify that the preceding ninety-six (96) paragraphs are atrue copy of the reasons for judgment of the Honourable Justice Clearydeliveredon 13 October 2014.

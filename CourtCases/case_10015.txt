FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA AT PARRAMATTA FILE NUMBER:PAC 4152 of 2013 Ms Selim Applicant And Mr Selim Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT MrSelim, 52 years of age (the husband) and Ms Selim, 46 years of age(the wife) met in Egypt in August1985. The husband came toAustralia in August 1986 and he and the wife married in Australia in August1986. Theyhave five children, three who are adults, Mr S Selim (male) born in 1987, Ms RSelim born in 1991, Mr D Selim born in 1994 (20years), E born in 1999 (almost15 years) and F born in 2001 (almost 13 years). Theyseparated under the same roof in approximately May 2012 and the husband movedout of the former matrimonial home in May 2013. The wife remained living in thehome with the four youngest children. Theparties have been unable to resolve their property dispute and have asked theCourt to do this. APPLICATIONS Thewife seeks orders to the following effect:- Thatthe husband transfer to her his interest in the former matrimonial home atSuburb C in return for the payment by her to him ofthe sum of$180 767; Thatthere be a superannuation splitting order which would in effect split$50 000 from the wifes First State Super interestin favour of thehusband; Thatotherwise the parties be declared the sole owners respectively of all otherproperty and superannuation in their possession and/orcontrol. Onthe other hand, the husband seeks orders to the following effect: Thathe transfer his interest in the said home to the wife upon payment by her to himof the sum of $600 000; Thatin default of such payment the said home be sold and from the net proceeds he bepaid the $600 000 with the balance paid to thewife; 3. That there be no superannuation splitting order; and Thata similar order be made in relation to remaining property and superannuation asthat sought by the wife. BACKGROUND Thebackground facts are as follows. Atthe commencement of their marriage the parties lived with the wifesparents at their home. Inapproximately December 1986 they moved to live in a rented apartment at SuburbA. Theparties separated in March/April 1987 with the wife returning to live with herparents until approximately April 1988. Then sheand the husband reconciled andlived at an apartment at Suburb G for six weeks when the apartment becameflooded. The parties thenmoved to an apartment at Suburb H. But four monthslater the apartment was broken into so the parties moved to live in a grannyflat at Suburb J. They purchased land at K Street, Suburb L and contractedCompany M to construct a home on the land. The costof this property was$39 000. This was funded from the parties savings and a loan of$31 000. They moved into their newhome in 1990. InJuly 1998 the parties purchased the property at N Street, Suburb C for$405 000. They borrowed $380 000 to assist funding thepurchase andused savings to pay the balance. Theydemolished the home on this land and built a new home thereon. This costapproximately $400 000 funded from savings and a secondmortgage withSelect Credit Union for $382 519. Theparties rented their new home out for approximately 12 months, continuing tolive in their Suburb L property. Then they movedinto Suburb C. They soldSuburb L for approximately $292 500 and applied the net proceeds of sale toreduce the loan on Suburb C. In2004 the husbands father died and the husband inherited a 1/6 interest inhis fathers home in Egypt. His three brothersall live at this propertywith their families. In2006 the parties purchased the property at I Street, Suburb C for $1.4M. Theysold their N Street, Suburb C property for approximately$1.266M. The netproceeds of sale were approximately $257 630. Asindicated above, in May 2012 the parties separated under the same roof. InJune 2012 the husband commenced a relationship with Ms B with whom he commencedliving after leaving the former matrimonial homein May 2013. They remainliving together. CREDIT The wife Thewife was not very responsive to questions in relation to her financialcircumstances. It is clear that she has drawn down substantialfunds from themortgage and that she has established numerous credit card accounts since thehusband left the former matrimonialhome. Yet the wife has not been able toprovide a convincing explanation for how a considerable amount of the fundsinvolved havebeen dealt with. Sheis the person who has the knowledge about these matters. Yet time and againwhen asked about specific transactions on her variousaccounts she repliedI dont know or it was a long time ago ormy guess would be. Herattitude to the important financial transactions following physical separationof the parties is exemplified by her attitude tothe serious matter of preparingher first financial statement sworn by her as being true on 26 September2013 and filed the followingday. In this important document she failed to makeany reference to any funds in any bank account. Almost incredibly in my view,she said that she left the preparation of the financial statement to herprevious solicitor and that she did not read the documentwhen she signedit. Informationcontained in her affidavit in chief, her recent financial statement and her oralevidence during cross-examination isin conflict with information in the earlierfinancial statement. I shall refer in more detail to these inconsistenciesbelow. Sufficeit to say that I have serious reservations about the wifes truthfulnessand consider her evidence where not supportedby documents as beingunreliable. The husband Onthe other hand, the husband was reasonably responsive in his answers toquestions but not on all occasions. Hemade concessions and was much more balanced in his assessment of thewifes contributions than the wife was about his. Generallywhere their evidence is in conflict, I prefer the evidence of the husband tothat of the wife. FINANCIAL MATTERS SINCE SEPARATION Thereis a major issue concerning significant increase in the balance of the mortgage,and also in the state of the wifes indebtednesson credit cards, sinceseparation. Itis common ground that at the time the husband left the former matrimonial homethe outstanding mortgage balance was approximately$680 000. It is now$795 000. Ialso accept that the total of outstanding balances on the wifes creditcards at separation was $3284.77 comprising $713.42on the ANZ Visa Card and$2571.35 on the HSBC card. Current outstanding credit card balances are a totalof $92 965. Ishall first refer to the issue about the liabilities alleged by the wife otherthan the mortgage. The wife alleges that she hasthe following suchliabilities: $ 1. Macquarie Bank Visa 19,836 2. Westpac Bank Visa 13,278 3. Woolworths Ltd Mastercard 6,900 4. Citibank Visa 14,769 5. St George Bank Master Card 3,298 6. ANZ Amex (No 1) 19,947 7. ANZ Amex (No 2) 14,937 Personalloan from Ms O (wifes sister) 7,000 Personalloan from Ms R Selim 42,500 __________ Total $142,465 Sincethe husband left the former matrimonial home in May 2013 the wife hasestablished each of the credit card accounts except theANZ Amex account(No 1) which is a re-generated account from the ANZ credit card account inlong time use by the wife. Iam satisfied that the outstanding liabilities on these accounts are as statedabove. Therewere strong submissions on behalf of each of the parties about theseliabilities. It was submitted on behalf of the husbandthat the Court shouldsimply disregard these as liabilities solely attributable to the wife. Learnedcounsel for the husband undertookdetailed analysis of the credit card movementslooking at cash withdrawals, transfers and BPay internet payments. For thecalendaryear 2013 the total of these transactions was $221 560. But thisincluded the approximately $55 000 drawdowns referred to aboveas well asapproximately $45 000 of money which the wife said was Ms R Selimsmoney about which there was considerable issue. Asimilar analysis was undertaken by those representing the wife and similarfigures were arrived at. Whatis clear is that the wife has spent a lot of money and incurred a substantiallevel of indebtedness. Itwas said on behalf of the wife that after the husband left the formermatrimonial home in May 2013 the wife struggled to make endsmeet and relied onher credit cards. She even established new credit cards to avail herself oflower interest rates and chargesfor new customers and did balance transfersfrom the old accounts. It was said that with children going to university hercostsincreased and she was shouldering the entire burden of supporting thechildren for seven months until the husband started payingchild support inJanuary 2014. I accept the latter part of this. Onthe other hand it was submitted on behalf of the husband that when the partieswere together under the same roof the husband paidthe mortgage payments of $700- $800 per week and the wife paid the living costs. They were able to have agood standard of livingand credit card debts were only approximately $3500. When the husband left, he no longer paid the mortgage payments but neitherdidthe wife and she negotiated the moratorium with the Bank. It was submittedtherefore that nothing really changed and the wifeshould have been able to paythe living costs of herself and the children without having to accumulate creditcard debts of anythinglike the magnitude of what has occurred. Imust say I think this is too simplistic an approach. It is clear to me that onething that has occurred to increase the wifescosts is that she has beenpaying a lot of money towards the parties daughters who are attendinguniversity. She has beenfunding their HECS fees, books and other costs and shehas been giving them money. Thedifficulty is that one cannot be entirely clear about the appropriateness of allthe wifes expenditure because she hasnot given a full account. Doingthe best I can in these difficult and frustrating circumstances I find theoutstanding credit card liabilities and the liabilityto Ms R Selim tobe: $ 1. Macquarie Bank Visa 19,836 2. Westpac Bank Visa 13,278 3. Woolworths Ltd Mastercard 6,900 4. Citibank Visa 14,769 5. St George Bank MasterCard 3,298 6. ANZ Amex (No 1) 19,947 7. ANZ Amex (No 2) 14,937 Personalloan from Ms R Selim 27,500 ___________ Total $120,465 Ihave disallowed the $7000 alleged remnant of the alleged loan to thewifes sister and I have removed from the alleged loanto Ms R Selim of$42 500 the $15 000 to leave a liability of $27 500 which is forthe legal fees of the wife paid by Ms R Selim. Ishall discuss these matters further below. Inrelation to the alleged liability of the wife to her sister Ms O for $7000, thewife said that upon the death of their mother thewifes sister loaned herroughly $37 000 being her sisters inheritance from theirmothers estate. The wife saidthat this money was given in cash. Inmy view there are several difficulties with this assertion. Firstly, the wifemade no mention of this alleged liability in heraffidavit in chief. Thewife did mention the liability in her first financial statement sworn on26 September 2013 deposing that she then owed her sister$10 000. Butduring cross-examination the wife said that such a reference was incorrect andthat at the time she owed her sister$27 000. Subsequently the wife saidthat she had repaid her sister $17 000 which consisted of one payment of$8000 and another paymentof $9000, the wife asserting that she had paid theseamounts to friends who had taken the money to her sister in the US in August2013 and February 2014. If this was correct, on the basis that $17 000 hadbeen repaid from $27 000 this would leave a current liabilityof$10 000 not $7000 as claimed. In any event, the figures given by the wifedid not appear to be consistent which did not inspireconfidence about the truthof the wifes assertions. Inaddition, it was common ground that the wife never informed the husband aboutthis alleged loan. She said that they were not speaking. Further,as I remarked upon during submissions, the wife could have filed an affidavit byher sister about this and she did not. I draw the inference that such anaffidavit would not have assisted the wife. Givenall these matters and the poor regard generally I have for the wifesevidence, I am far from persuaded that there wasany such loan and that thewifes assertions in this regard should not be applied to adjust the poolof available propertyas against the husband. If I am wrong in this regard thewife will just have to account to her sister from her own resources. Thewife also asserts that she owes the parties daughter Ms R Selim$42 500. She said that in 2009 or 2010 she borrowed $15000 from Ms RSelim. The wife said that recently she borrowed two additional amounts to atotal of $27 500 from Ms R Selim to payher solicitors. Therewas no mention of these matters in the wifes affidavit in chief. Thehusband said he had no knowledge about any loanin 2009/2010 from Ms R Selim toher mother. Ithink it more probable than not that the $27 500 Ms R Selim paid to thewifes solicitors came from Ms R Selims ownsources. But on theother hand the wife has failed to persuade me about $15 000 in loans shesaid were made in 2009/2010. She bearsthe onus of proof. She cannot point toany document to support her assertions. Learned counsel for the husband saidthat one mighthave the sensitivity not to expect an affidavit to be filed by MsR Selim. But at least the wife should have arranged for documentsto beavailable at Court to prove these loans. I agree and reject the wifesassertion about owing Ms R Selim $15 000. AsI said above, at the time the husband left the former matrimonial home in May2013 the outstanding balance on the home loan wasapproximately $680 000. It is now $795 000. Iaccept that during earlier years both the husband and the wife had beencontributing to the mortgage. The wife said that from late2010 thefamilys living costs paid by her were such that she did not havesufficient funds to contribute to the mortgage. She did assert that she madethe occasional mortgage repayment after this date but the documentary evidencedoes not support suchan assertion. I am satisfied that the husband paid theentirety of the mortgage repayments for the period at least 18 months priortothe time he left in May 2013. Buthe did not make any mortgage payments after this time. Thewife negotiated with the bank for a moratorium on mortgage repayments on thebasis that interest only would accrue on the loanbecause she said she did nothave the funds to pay. Thisongoing increase in the parties indebtedness on their home loan wasexacerbated by the wife drawing down on the mortgagetwice in August 2013. Thefirst drawdown was $30 000 on 2 August 2013 and a further $25 564 wasdrawn down on 23 August 2013. Thesedraw downs and what the wife did with the money have been a longstanding issuebetween the parties. On10 December 2013 an order was made by the registrar to the effect that on orbefore 24 January 2014 the wife provide to the husbanddetails of anyfunds drawn down on the home mortgage from 1 July 2013 to date including fullparticulars as to how such fundswere applied or otherwise expended. Thewife failed to comply with this order. Indeed the first information the wifegave the husband about this was by a letter fromthe wifes previoussolicitors dated 27 March 2014. But as learned counsel for the husbandsubmitted, most of the informationprovided with the letter related to theperiod prior to the wifes draw downs. Inher affidavit at paragraph 31 the wife provided the following explanation abouthow the funds were expended. Ispent the said money I drew down as follows: (a) $8,000 in August 2013  ANZ credit card (b) $2,300 in October 2013  HSBC credit card (c) $8,000 in August 2013  part payment to repay loan from my sister,[Ms O] (d) $9,000 in March 2014  part payment to repay loan from my sister, [MsO] (e) $5,400 [Ms R Selihs] HECS (Semester 1, 2009 and Semester 2,2012) (f) $8,000 legal fees (Barclays Law) (g) $12,099 [Ms R Selihs] HECS (Semester 1, 2014) (h) $3,000 [Ms R Selihs] HECS (Semester 1, 2014) Total $55,799 Thereare numerous difficulties with this explanation. Onedifficulty is that it appears that the wife did not undertake much analysis ofrelevant bank and credit card account statementsbut relied on her memory. Ithas been clear during cross-examination that her memory failed her many times inrelation to mattersof detail. So far as the $12 099 said to have beenpaid for Ms R Selihs HECS, in fact this was paid from one of the creditcards. Itis clear that the wife did not consult the husband about the withdrawals nor themanner in which she expended the funds. Sofar as the alleged expenditure of $8000 and $9000 to repay the alleged loan tothe wifes sister is concerned, I have alreadyindicated that I am notpersuaded about the existence of such loan. The$8000 legal fees I accept and I regard this as the wife using matrimonialproperty to pay her legal costs. So this is reallyan advance of property. Atotal of at least $20 499 has been used by the wife to pay part of the HECSfees for Ms R Selih and Ms D Selih. The husband wasnot consulted. I can seeno reason why he should be expected to shoulder this cost. This is a total of$45 499 ($8000 + $9000 +$8000 + $20 499 = $45 499). Ido not accept the wifes explanation for approximately $45 000 of thealleged $55 799. I regard this money, therefore, asan advance ofmatrimonial property in favour of the wife and I shall take it into account whenconsidering relevant matters pursuantto s 75(2) of the Act. THE APPLICABLE LAW Sub-section79(1) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) (the Act) providesto the effect that in property settlement proceedings the Court may make suchorder as itconsiders appropriate altering the interests of the parties to themarriage in the property. Sub-section79(2) provides that the Court shall not make an order under this section unlessit is satisfied that, in all the circumstances,it is just and equitable to makethe order. Sub-section79(4) sets out various matters which must be taken into account in consideringwhat order (if any) should be made underthe section. These matters includedirect and indirect contributions, financial and otherwise by or on behalf of aparty or a childto the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any propertyof the parties, contributions by a party to the welfare of theirfamilyincluding as a homemaker or parent, relevant matters referred to in s 75(2)and the other matters referred to in s 79(4). Theoperation of s 79 was the subject of consideration by the High Court in thecase of Stanford v Stanford [2012] HCA 52; (2012) FLC 93-518. InStanford the majority said (at page 86,640) in referring to ss 79(2)and 79(4) as follows: ...the requirements of the two sub-sections are not to be conflated. In every casein which a property settlement order under s 79 is sought, it is necessaryto satisfy the court that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable tomake the order. Theexpression just and equitable is a qualitative description of aconclusion reached after examination of a rangeof potentially competingconsiderations. ... while the power given by s 79 is not to beexercised in accordance with fixed rules, nevertheless, three fundamentalpropositions must not be obscured. TheHigh Court said that the first of these propositions is for the court toidentify, according to ordinary common law and equitableprinciples, theexisting legal and equitable interests of the parties in theproperty. Thesecond is that although s 79 confers a broad power on the court, it is nota power that is to be exercised according to an unguided judicial discretion. It mustbe exercised in accordance with legal principles, including theprinciples which the Act itself lays down. TheHigh Court said that the third fundamental proposition is that the question ofwhether the order is just and equitableis not to be answered bybeginning from the assumption that one or other party has the right to have theproperty of the partiesdivided between them or has the right to an interest inmarital property which is fixed by reference to the various matters set outins 79(4). To conclude that making an order is just andequitable only because of and by reference to various matters ins 79(4), without a separate consideration of s 79(2) would be toconflate the statutory requirements and ignore the principles laiddown by the Act. Andthe High Court majority went on to say (at page 86,642) as follows: ...The fundamental propositions that have been identified require that a court havea principled reason for interfering with theexisting legal and equitableinterests of the parties to the marriage and whatever may have been their statedor unstated assumptionsand agreements about property interests during thecontinuance of the marriage. Inmy view, there is a principled reason for making an order to alterthe parties interest in their propertyin this case because theypurchased their home for their mutual use. Given the financial historyparticularly since separation andthe respective needs of the parties it wouldbe unfair to leave them simply with their legal interests in property. Accordingly,in my view, it would be just and equitable to make an order,pursuant to s 79(2) of the Act.

CONTRIBUTIONS Neitherparty had any property of significant value at the commencement of theirmarriage and cohabitation. The wife was 18 yearsof age and working as atrainee manager. Theparties lived at the wifes parents home. Uponarriving in Australia the husband undertook a six month course in learningEnglish. He worked in a manual labouring position. In1987 the husband commenced working at Company P at Suburb Q. From approximately1989 the husband worked as a metalworker at BusinessT six days per week forapproximately five years. From1998 the husband has worked for Business U, his current employer. Apartfrom periods around the birth of the children, the wife has been in full timeemployment. From 1989 to 1990 she worked as adriver but then moved intoadministrative positions in a government agency. For many years she has workedin her current positionin a communications role. Thereare differences between the parties respective accounts of thecontributions they have made to renovating and buildinghomes. The wife hasgiven a very detailed account of her involvement in these projects includinghaving procured building materialsand fittings, provided supervision to varioustradespersons and particularly having undertaken painting. She has put in issuesomeof the husbands claims, for example that he built a fence and thehusband has made concessions in respect of some of the contributionsclaimed inhis affidavit. Whatbecame clear during the hearing is that each of the parties committed themselvesas fully as possible to these projects aroundthe demands of their respectivepaid employment positions and of course the demands of the children. Theytook the same approach in relation to their responsibilities to the welfare ofthe family unit and as homemakers and parents. The wife has worked shift workand when she was doing this at night the husband became solely responsible forthe children. Butthe wifes shift work also provided her withopportunity to undertake housework through the day time. Similarly, there weretimes when the wife was working and the husband was at home caring for thechildren. Thiswas a long marriage and a marriage during which five children have been raised,three now to adulthood. It is somewhat triteto observe that the demands on theparents of providing for, and raising, five children must be huge indeed. Tothe parentscredit, they have risen to this challenge and the childrenare all making out very well in life. Theclear view this Court has is of two parents who have worked very hard, not onlyat their paid employment, but also in the homeas well as in building andrenovating properties. Neither of them has been lazy, or irresponsible or otherthan committed to dotheir very best for their family. Neither of them has beenunemployed, apart from the relatively brief periods the wife has takenleavefrom her paid work around the times of the births of each of the children, quiteproperly, to concentrate on their times ofgreatest need for care by her. Butshe has rejoined the paid workforce in a timely way. No doubt the considerablefinancial costof such a large family has concentrated her focus on the need toresume her income-producing work without undue delay. Sotaking account of all the evidence about all the contributions by each of theparties up to the time that the husband left thehome my clear view is that theyhave been equal. Atthe time the husband left the home in May 2013 the four youngest childrenremained in the home in the wifes care. I acceptthat this became a muchmore difficult time for the wife, especially financially. She did not pay themortgage. As previously said,she negotiated with the Bank for it to accept thesituation that repayments would not be made and the outstanding mortgage balancewould increase on the basis of payment of interest only. This is of course asignificant component in the current increased outstandingamount of themortgage compared with the balance as at May 2013. Aswas submitted on behalf of the husband, the wife did have the benefit of livingin the former matrimonial home without paying mortgagepayments. Butthe wife had the sole physical burden of the children from May 2013. And shehad the entire financial burden of them until thehusband commenced paying childsupport in January 2014. Onthe other hand, the husband was living apart from the family and with hispartner, no doubt removed from the day to day demandswhich had in factincreased on the wife by virtue of her sole care of the children. But thehusband had to pay rent for his accommodationand from December 2013 hecommenced paying child support. Inmy view, given the wifes sole care of the children since May 2013unassisted by child support for in excess of seven months,it is appropriate toassess her contributions since separation to have been greater than those of thehusband. Inall these circumstances, therefore, in my view, the proper assessment of theparties contributions overall is that thoseof the wife have been 53 percent and those of the husband have been 47 per cent. S 75(2) MATTERS Thewife is 46 years of age and she is in reasonable health. Her income is $2000per week from her full time employment in a communicationsrole with agovernment agency. Inaddition the wife receives a share dividend of $16 per week, family tax benefitsof $119 per week and $368 child support per weekpaid by the husband. Onall current indications the wife can be expected to be able to continue to earnincome and accumulate superannuation at her presentrate. Thewife has the care and control of the four youngest children of the parties buttwo are adults. Ms R Selim is studying at universityand anticipates severalmore years at university although this would be for higher and additionaldegrees. MsR Selim is also studying at university and proposes undertaking a Masters degreein 2015. Soit is the younger two children who are at secondary school, E in Year 9 and F inYear 8. They are respectively almost 15 and 13years of age. Thewife has superannuation with First State Super with a value of$140 858. Ihave referred to the wifes property. Onthe other hand, the husband is 52 years of age and he is also in reasonablehealth. His income is $2000 per week from his positionin a supervisory rolewith Business U. Thehusband has been employed by his present employer now for a long period. In myview, he can be expected to continue in his presentor similar position for theforeseeable future. Thehusband does not have the primary care of either of the two youngerchildren. Thehusband has superannuation with Care Super, Australian Super and AMP, hisbenefits having a total value of $148 745. Thehusband is cohabiting with Ms B who shares some living costs with the husband. Her means are modest. She is unemployed and inreceipt of government benefitsin the amount of approximately $320 per fortnight. Thehusband has paid $2500 legal costs and I take this into account. He will bepaying his outstanding legal costs from his shareof the property. Thewife will continue to have the physical and financial responsibility for E and Ffor quite some years yet and this is a significantmatter to take into account. It was submitted on her behalf that there should be a 10 per centadjustment in the wifes favouron account of s 75(2) matters. In myview, even if the only relevant s 75(2) matter was this matter, 10 per centwould be a little high given the ages of the children and the wifescapacity for employment,and her age. Butin any event I need to take account of the fact that I am unable to accept thewifes explanation for disbursement of themajor part of approximately$55 000 drawdowns on the loan and, as I have said, I propose to consider anappropriate adjustment forthis. Ialso must take into account the fact that the wife has had the benefit of almost$60 000 having been paid towards her legal feeson the basis as indicatedabove, largely the indebtedness I accept on credit cards and the $27 500liability to Ms R Selim. Thewife has also had the benefit of $21 000 paidin legal costs to her previous solicitors although the source of such money isnotclear. Sothese matters have to be taken into account against the adjustment which wouldotherwise be just and equitable for considerationof the responsibility the wifewill likely have for the younger children. Takingaccount of all relevant matters therefore, including the fact that the wife is alittle ahead of the husband in relation tocontributions, in my view, while itis clear there needs to be an adjustment in her favour to achieve a just andequitable order,that adjustment can only be modest. In my view, it is3 per cent. CONCLUSION AND FOURTH STEP Thewife will have 56 per cent of the property and superannuation available fordivision between the parties. This is property andsuperannuation with a valueof $701 778. The wife has thefollowing: $ IAGshares 8,287 Toyotamotor vehicle 3,000 Householdcontents 1,000 Superannuation 140,858 ___________ $153,145 Butthe wife has the following liabilities (asadjusted): $ MacquarieBank Visa 19,836 WestpacBank Visa 13,278 WoolworthsLtd MasterCard 6,900 CitibankVisa 14,769 StGeorge Bank MasterCard 3,298 ANZAmex (No 1) 19,947 ANZAmex (No 2) 14,937 Personalloan from Ms R Selim 27,500 __________ $120,465 Accordingly,the wife has net property and superannuation with a value of $32 680($153 145 - $120 465 = $32 680). Toachieve property and superannuation with a value of $701 778 the wife wouldrequire property with a further value of $669 098 ($701778 -$32 680 = $669 098). This would come from the former matrimonialhome. Ifthe home was sold this would produce $1 820 000 on the evidence beforethe Court. There is no evidence of sale or legal costsand I do not take suchinto account in this exercise. But there is $795 000 owing on themortgage. This would be equity of $1 025000 ($1 820 000 - $795 000 = $1 025 000). Thewife is to have $669 098 (or 65.278 per cent) thereof which would leave$355 902 or 34.722 per cent for the husband. Onthe other hand, the husband is to have 44 per cent of the available property andsuperannuation which is $551 397. Thehusband has thefollowing: $ One-sixthinterest in the property in Egypt 37,000 Holdenmotor vehicle 7,500 Boat 250 Householdcontents 2,000 Superannuation 148,745 __________ $195,495 Toachieve property with a value of $551 397 the husband would requireadditional property with a value of $355 902 ($551 397 - $195495= $355 902). This would have to be either by a payment in this amount fromthe wife or an appropriate portion of the net proceedsof sale of the formermatrimonial home (34.722 per cent). Thewife is most desirous to pay the husband for his interest in the home. She saidshe had approval to assume sole responsibilityfor the existing mortgage of$795 000. She also said that her brother and sister would be prepared toloan up to $250 000 to herfor this purpose. And, as indicated above, thewife would seek a superannuation splitting order to adjust in thehusbandsfavour $50 000 from the wifes interest in hersuperannuation. Butto achieve a just and equitable order, the wife would have to pay to the husbandthe sum of $355 902. In my view, on the evidencebefore the Court thiswould be well beyond the capacity of the wife to do. In any event, there areother difficulties for her. Her evidence was clear that after the husband leftthe home she did not have the capacity to pay the mortgage. She has assertedthat her financial situation was so tight that she needed to keep increasing hercredit card indebtedness. So on her history, thisCourt would not be confidentthat the wife could maintain such a high level of mortgage repayments. And shestill has significantliabilities. Thereis another difficulty for her. This is that I would not regard it fair to thehusband to require him to take an interest inthe wifes superannuation byway of a superannuation splitting order. He does not want this and wishes toavail himself ofas much of the matrimonial property as possible. For all thesereasons, in my view, it would not be appropriate to make orders otherthan for asale of the home. Uponsale of the home the wife would have her property and superannuation as referredto above as well as a fund of approximately$669 098. But she hassignificant liabilities. The wife will be able to use the major part of thistowards financing a more modesthome for herself and the children. Or she couldapply it towards renting a home. Onthe other hand, upon sale of the home the husband will have his property andsuperannuation as referred to above as well as a lumpsum of approximately$355 902. He would be able to use this as a deposit on a home or apply ittowards rent, subject to paying hislegal costs. Theorders I propose will not affect either partys capacity to earnincome. RATES Thereis one remaining matter which needs to be addressed. The rates on the formermatrimonial home have not been paid for some years. The parties will have topay these in the proportions 65.278 per cent thereof by the wife and 34.722 percent thereof by the husband. RECONSIDERATION / ORDERS Afterconcluding the oral judgment above, there was an application by learnedsolicitor for the wife to the effect that the Courtprovide the wife with theopportunity to pay the husband the sum of $355 902 as required by thejudgment. Learned solicitor tenderedemail communications by the wifessister Ms O and her brother Mr O in which the sister indicated that she wouldprovide $150000 to the wife and the wifes brother indicated that hewould provide her with $200 000. It was also clear that the wifewasnegotiating with a mortgage broker on behalf of a financier to refinance theexisting outstanding mortgage. Inall these circumstances, notwithstanding my views expressed above, I formed theview that it would be fair to each of the partiesto provide the wife with theopportunity to pay the husband as required under the judgment for a period of 56days. In my view,it would be in the husbands interest to receivepayment in this manner as distinct from having to wait for an indeterminatetimeto receive his payment from a sale of the property. I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-three(133) paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment of the HonourableJustice Johnston delivered on 3 October2014.

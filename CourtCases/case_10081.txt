IT IS NOTED that publication of this judgment by this Court under thepseudonym Millerd & Millerd has been approved by the Chief Justicepursuant to s 121(9)(g) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA AT SYDNEY FILE NUMBER:SYC 2489 of 2012 Mr Millerd Applicant And Ms Millerd Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT MrMillerd (the husband) and Ms Millerd (the wife)married and commenced co-habitation in 1993. They havethree children aged 17years, 15 years and 12 years. Theyseparated in February 2012 when the wife and the children left the formermatrimonial home in Suburb E and the husband remainedin the home. Thewife and the children then lived with the wifes mother. Theapplication before the Court is the husbands application seeking a saleof two properties. One property is the former matrimonialhome in which thehusband now lives with his new partner and her daughter. The second property, onL Street, Sydney (L Street)is owned by a company in which theparties are equal shareholders but the husband is the sole director. Thehusbands application is for interim property pursuant to s 79 of theFamily Law Act 1975 (Cth) (the Act). He asks theCourt to order the sale of both properties and the distribution of part of theproceeds, firstlyto pay the mortgage over the former matrimonial home (which heasserts is also secured over L Street) and then to pay $100,000 toeach of theparties to be used for legal fees. Thewife opposes the application in circumstances where it is her case that thehusband has committed waste and acts of financialmisconduct. Thehusband is a financial professional and has a masters degree. Thewife says, and it does not appear to be disputed, that the husband handled theirfinancial affairs. Theproceedings are conducted as an interim determination on the documents and it isnot possible to resolve, in those circumstances,many of the issues indispute. BRIEF FINANCIAL HISTORY Inorder to place their respective submissions in context, it is necessary tounderstand the financial history of the marriage, inso far as can be done in aninterim hearing. In1994 the wifes father died, leaving a substantial estate. The wife wasentitled to receive her inheritance when she turned35 years of age. Inmid-1994 the parties purchased a property at Suburb U for $140,000 using amortgage of $112,000 and the balance from the wifessavings (the Uproperty). The wifes mother guaranteed the mortgage. Inlate 1994 they purchased a property in Suburb F for $558,000 (the Fproperty). The wifes mother gave them$308,500 towards thepurchase price. The balance was borrowed. In May 1995 the wifes mothergave them a further $35,000 touse for renovations. In1995 the parties sold the U property for $146,000. In2003 the husband was made redundant from his employment. He received aredundancy package which the wife asserts was $128,474.It is the wifescase that only $82,957 went into the parties joint accounts. Thewifes mother lent the parties $110,000 so they could make mortgagepayments. That money was repaid from the wifesinheritance. In2004, the husband incorporated a company, X Pty Limited. The parties are equalshareholders and the husband is the sole director.He also registered the nameZ Company. The husband and Mr W were directors of the company. Thehusband is a consultantin the health services industry. Thehusband also incorporated V Company of which he is a 75 per cent shareholder. VCompany was incorporated in Dubai. In addition,he has a shareholding in NLimited UK (N Limited). The wife says the shareholding is 20 percent. On20 October 2005 the wife received $1,000,112.40 from her inheritance. $870,911was used to retire debt. InMay 2006 the wife was given an apartment in K Road, Suburb U by her grandmother(U apartment). InFebruary 2007 the wife sold the U apartment, receiving a net amount of $287,174.The sum of $80,000 from the sale money was divertedto repay a loan drawn downby the husband secured over the F property, without, the wife says, herknowledge. Thewife then purchased an apartment in Suburb R for $995,000 (the Rproperty). The balance of the purchase money wasborrowed. She was thesole registered proprietor. InApril 2007, the wife received $930,000 from her inheritance. InAugust 2007 the wife received a further $130,000 from her inheritance. InDecember 2007 the parties purchased the former matrimonial home for $1,275,000.The wifes inheritance was used for the deposit.It is the wifescase that she was unaware that the balance of the purchase price was borrowed. Thewife received a further $2,966,473 from her inheritance in December 2007.The total amount received was $5,026,585 InDecember 2009, X Pty Ltd purchased L Street for approximately $1,600,000. Thefunds came from the wifes inheritance. Thewife did not consent to thepurchase. It is her case that she specifically told the husband that theproperty was too expensive andthat he was not to use her inheritance to buy it.That position appears to be conceded by the husband. Inan email to the wife dated 23 November 2011, the husband says that he missed theauction and later spoke to the agent who toldhim the property had been passedin. The husband says he impulsively signed the documents. TheCommonwealth Bank (CBA) was not prepared to lend X Pty Ltd themoney to purchase L Street. The husband says in hisemail to the wife thatAt that time I was snookered and had to use the offset funds. Theoffset funds were the moneyfrom the wifes inheritance. The husband sayshe believed he spoke with the wife at the time but cannot say she agreed orunderstoodthe implications. InSeptember 2010 the parties sold the F property for $2.6 million. It is thewifes case that she believed that the propertywas unencumbered howeverthere was a mortgage to the CBA of $243,350 which was discharged on settlement. Theproceeds of the F property were used by the husband to purchase, through X PtyLtd, shares in T Corporation for $1.8 million.The wife gives evidence that TCorporation is a private Singapore based company. Thehusband, in his affidavit sworn 17 July 2014 says (the wife) was involvedin this consideration and decision making process. Thewife may have been involved but says she did not agree. Annexed tothe wifes affidavit sworn 14 October 2014is an email from the husband tothe wife dated 23 November 2011. In the email he refers to discussing theinvestment with the wifeand trying to gain her approval. The email makes itclear that, at least a part of the transaction, the purchase of 800,000 sharesfor $170,000 was conducted without the wifes knowledge. Thehusband says that the shares are now worth $400,000. On23 February 2012 the wife and the children moved out of the former matrimonialhome. Thepresent financial position of the parties is as follows: The husbandlives in the former matrimonial home with his new partner and her daughter. Sheis employed but there is no evidence ofher income or assets. Thehusbands income from his business is, according to his FinancialStatement sworn 17 July 2014, $2,000 per week or $104,000per annum. The wife and thechildren live with her mother. The wifereceives the rent from the R property of $812 per week. The rent from LStreet is $10,068.21 per month which is paid into the X Pty Ltd Bankaccount. The mortgagepayments for the various loans are $13,828 per week. The balanceoutstanding under the mortgages is $1,864,562. The wife valuesthe former matrimonial home at $1,650,000 and the R property at $1,250,000. Thehusband values the former matrimonialhome at $2,000,000 and the R property at$1,450,000. L Street isagreed to be valued at $1,900,000 Thoseare not the only items of property to be considered. Thewife in the final proceedings wishes to retain all of the assets. Thewife contributed her inheritance of $5,026,585 together with the proceeds ofsale of the U apartment of, she says, $367,174 (beingthe net proceeds togetherwith the amount used to repay the $80,000 draw down) to an asset pool which thehusband says is now worthconsiderably less than her contributions. Sheargues, in support of that application, that the husband has committed waste inapplying $1.8 million of the parties fundsto the purchase of the TCorporation shares which are now worth $400,000. Furtherthe wife says that, without her knowledge, the husband obtained loans from theCBA, secured over jointly owned assets, tofund electronic trading and to lendmoney to his brother Mr M. Itis the wifes case that the husband used some of those funds to lend moneyto N Limited. TheR property is now security for three Low Document loans with CBA and a ViridianLine of Credit. The wife says those transactionstook place without herknowledge or consent. Inrelation to the former matrimonial home, the wifes case is that shebelieved that the purchase was funded from her inheritance.She did not completeany loan application with the CBA. She did not speak to anyone at the CBA abouta loan. She did not sign a letterof offer relating to the loan. She did notsign a mortgage authority. She did not sign the mortgage. Itis the wifes case that the husband used money from the former matrimonialhome loan to invest in N Limited, to invest inZ Company and that he sent someof the money off-shore. She was unaware of these transactions. Thewife says that when the F property was sold, the CBA released the F property assecurity for outstanding loans and, instead, tooksecurity over the R property.The wife says that she did not speak to anyone at CBA about this transaction orauthorise the transaction.She did not sign any documents. Thewife is about to institute proceedings in the Supreme Court of NSW against theCBA in relation to the advances made, she claims,without her knowledge. Thewife has issued subpoenas and has engaged a forensic accountant to undertake atracing exercise in order to better understandthe financial transactions thatthe husband has completed. That report is not yet available. The wife will seekleave to rely onthe report as an adversarial experts report. Havingregard to all of those matters, it cannot be said that the wifes claim tobe entitled to all of the assets of the marriageis not arguable. Thenet asset pool is not yet defined. Thewife alleges that the husband has lent $137,029 from joint funds to N Limited,that he has lent $90,000 to Mr W and that he hasinvested $520,000 in Z Companyand V Company. Those allegations are untested Thehusband in his Financial Statement sworn 17 July 2014 lists his assets asincluding: TCorporation $180,126 VCompany (75 per cent of shares) $1 N Limited (UKCompany) (20 per cent of shares) $50,000 S PtyLimited (49 per cent of shares) $49 V InternationalPty. Ltd. (100 per cent of shares) $1 Inthe notes to the Financial Statement he records that 50 per cent of Z Companywas transferred in December 2011 to other50% equity holder inexchange for 50 per cent equity in V (International) Pty Ltd. It is not possibleto ascertain from thedocument whether this is the same entity as VInternational Pty Ltd. Thereis likely to be an issue about the value of both Z Company and at least one ofthe V companies. In his CurriculumVitae which the wife said shereceived in 2007, the husband said: For the last 8 years, developed consulting business ([Z Company]) and aninformation technology business ([V International Pty Ltd])with turnover inexcess of $3.25m per annum. OfV International Pty Ltd, the husband said that the business had secured theexclusive worldwide rights (excluding USA and Canada)to a services managementsystem and that he had established a joint venture in the Middle East. Thehusband said that the systemhas been implemented in 25 health servicesproviders in the Middle East and at Y Hospital. In 2012, the husband says thatthe turnoverof that business alone was $3.25 million. In those circumstanceshis estimate of value of $1 may attract some scrutiny. Thusthe husbands application falls to be considered in circumstances wherethere is no certainty as to the final quantum ofthe asset pool and where thewife has an application on foot that she receives the whole pool. Theapplication of the husband is couched as an interim property settlement. THE LAW Itis not disputed that the principles which give guidance to such an applicationare those set out in the decision of the Full Courtin Strahan & Strahan (2011) FLC 93-466 (Strahan). Itis not disputed that an order for interim property settlement can be made whereit is in the interests of justice and appropriateto do so. However,the Full Court in Strahan, at 85,634, cited with approval the decision ofan earlier Full Court in Zschokke & Zschokke [1996] FamCA 79; (1996) FLC 92-693 wherethe Court held: [i]t would seem an essential part of such an order that the advance offunds be a matter which the trial Judge must take into account, or at least haveregard to,in the determination of the final property settlement(emphasis added). At 83,220 the Full Court said: it must ...be anintegral part of any order under s 80(1)(h) for an advance of funds fromthe party in possession of the bulk of the partys assets [sic] to theother party, that suchadvance can then be taken into account in the propertysettlement, that is, it must be capable of satisfying part of the otherpartysentitlement (emphasis added). At 83,221 the Full Courtagain identified as a matter for consideration whether [theapplicant]will ultimately be entitled to sufficient funds by way of property settlement tomeet a requirement ... that the amount[under the] order could be taken intoaccount in the eventual property settlement order. At85,646 the Full Court in Strahan said: 136. As to the third matter identified at 79,930 by the Full Court inHarris, in discussion before us it was described as the adjustmentissue or claw-back issue. It was submittedby seniorcounsel for the Wife that it is relevant to consider whether an order would givethe applicant more than they wouldbe indubitably entitled to on a finalhearing or alternatively would it give them so much that it couldnot be adjustedon a final hearing? As we have observed the Full Courtin Zschokke at 83,220-221 stressed the importance of consideration of theadjustment issue if the power in s 80(1)(h) of the Act is beingexercised. We accept the submission and observe that this matter is relevantbecause the discretion conferredby the power in s 79 is to make such order asthe Court considers appropriate provided it is just and equitable to make theorder in circumstances wherethe power will not be exhausted by the interimorder. As Bryant CJ and Coleman J observed in Gabel v Yardley at [69]and [72] the interim order must be capable of variation or reversal withoutresort to s 79A of the Act or appeal. As Finn J said at [126] the interim ordermust be capable of alteration at any time prior to, or aspart of, thefinal exercise of the s 79 power. Andat 85,646, paragraph 137: 137. Once a court proceeds to exercise the power in s 79 of the Act, being inthe substantive phase, a court is required to undertake consideration of thematters in s 79(4) including by reference to s 79(4)(e) the matters in s 75(2)so far as they are relevant. However consideration of such matters may be briefand if it is established that it seems likelyto the Court that ... theapplicant ... will be likely receive by way of property settlement a sumsufficient to cover the advance,that would seem to be sufficient to enable theorder sought to be made: Zschokke; Polletti and Polletti per NyghJ and Wenz v Archer. As senior counsel for the Wife submitted, providedscope can be found within the assets of theparties for an order of the sizesought ... then that should be the end of the matter. In other words, insuch circumstancesthe applicant would only be receiving what he or she wasentitled to receive when the power was exhausted. Counselfor the husband was unable to refer to any passage from Strahan whichsupported his contention that, in circumstances where the Court could not besatisfied that any order made by way of interimproperty settlement could beclawed back, to use the language adopted in Strahan, aninterim property settlement order could be made. Icannot be satisfied that any order for the payment of money to the husband,which he will then disburse to pay his legal fees, canbe clawed back. Ifthe two properties at Suburb E and L Street are sold in accordance with hisapplication, then that order can never be reversedso as to give effect to thewifes application that she retains those properties. Thenet asset pool is not capable of being ascertained. The wifes wasteargument has not been determined. It cannot be assumed,even on the briefconsideration mandated in Strahan, that the husband will be entitled tothe amount he seeks. Ofmore significance, however, is the fact that to grant the husbandsapplication by way of interim orders would render thewifes applicationnugatory. Thehusbands application will be dismissed. I certify that thepreceding sixty-eight (68) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons forjudgment of the Honourable Justice Reesdelivered on 27 October2014.

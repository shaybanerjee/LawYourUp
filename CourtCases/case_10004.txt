FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA AT BRISBANE FILE NUMBER: BRC3538 of 2009 Mr Thor Applicant And Ms Dahler First Respondent And Cassandra Pullos Lawyers Pty Ltd Second Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT Thisvery sad matter involves a consideration of the parenting arrangements for G,born in 2003 and her sister, H born in 2004 (thechildren), whose parentsseparated on 6 February 2009. The childrens older sister, F, is an adult,having been born in 1994. Thematter has a long and tortured history and I apologise sincerely to the partiesfor adding further to the delay associated withits finalisation. Whilst,perhaps, illuminating, a recitation of the intricacies of its history doesnothing to advance the explanation for the parentingorders which must,inevitably, be made in the circumstances of this case. Onthe evidence before the Court[1],there can be no doubt that the proper parentingorder[2] - and that which is in thechildrens best interests - is one which will see them continue to livewith the father: as theyhave done since about October 2009. Such are thesymptoms and manifestations of the significant and debilitating mentalillness[3] enveloping the mother thatthe childrens time with her can only occur on whatever occasions, and inwhatever manner, the fatherdeems appropriate. Whilsta thorough investigation and consideration of the causativefactors[4] underlying themothers mental illness may once have been thought imperative to thedetermination of those parenting orderswhich are in the childrens bestinterests, this is no longer the case. Theextent of the mothers mental illness is such that causation matterslittle. The father is the childrens only functioningparent; he alone iscapable of providing for the childrens needs and discharging theobligations associated with parenthood.He is entrusted with ensuring that theyare not exposed to their mother when she is unwell but have the opportunity tospend timewith her when she is not - as F, who has been significantly involvedin helping the father to care for her younger sisters and whoserecounting to MsQ[5] I accept, says: the mother doesnot need supervision to spend time with the children when she is well. However,it is also clearfrom Ms Qs evidence that exposure to the mothersbelief system and behaviours, as manifested when she is not mentallywell, ishighly likely to significantly distress and, possibly, emotionally damage thetwo youngest children. Savefor specifically permitting appropriate written communication and the provisionof gifts by the mother to the children, I donot intend to make other specificorders regulating the communication between the children and the mother.Responsibility for facilitatingsuch communication, for example, by Skype, canonly realistically and practically be left to the father  and, perhaps, Fwho have already demonstrated a capacity to support the younger childrenin their  sometimes truncated  interactionswith the mother. Theallegations the father had sexually abused the children - including theparties oldest daughter - have been investigatedby Police and theDepartment of Child Safety and found to be unsubstantiated. As long ago as 2009,the younger childrens schoolshad no concerns about their behaviour andreported that they did not display any inappropriate sexual behaviours. Further,Ms Qsobservations of the childrens interactions with the fatherestablish only that they have close, warm and well establishedrelationshipswith him and enjoy spending time with him. Aslong ago as about August 2009, Ms Q expressed the opinion that the mothercontinued to seek further evidence to support her belief considered tobe genuinely held  that the father had sexually abused the children and,consequently, was likely tointerpret innocuous events  such as a childnot smiling in a photograph  in a way that supported this pre-existingbelief. In2010, Dr M noted the mother appeared to hold, with delusionalintensity, the belief the youngest child had been sexuallyabused by thefather. He considered she attempted to hide persecutory beliefs because sherealised others would consider them psychoticin nature. Exposureto such a belief structure  which appears prevalent when themothers mental ill-health manifests  isonly likely to cause thechildren significant upset, concern, anxiety and a destabilisation of theirsense of security in their current,relatively long-standing, carearrangement. Themothers cyclic, and apparently deteriorating, mental ill-health means sheis incapable of making decisions about any issuesrelating to the children. Sheis also incapable of making decisions about such issues jointly with the father.The childrensbest interests mandate the rebuttal of the presumption ofequal shared parental responsibility. The only sensible, child focusedandproper order in the childrens best interests can be that the father havesole parental responsibility for the major longterm issues relating tothem. Shouldthere be any doubt about the basis for the significant conclusions outlinedabove, regard need only be had to the followingevidence - forexample: havingsuffered a psychotic episode, the mother was admitted to hospital as aninvoluntary patient in December 2009 and dischargedon 12 February2010; themothers time with the children was suspended on 16 December2009; inabout April 2010, the mother attempted to remove the children from thefathers care  she in fact removed the youngestchild and took herto hospital seeking that she be physically examined in furtherance of her beliefthe child had been sexually abusedby the father; inApril 2010, Federal Magistrate Slack restrained the mother from approachingwithin 100 metres of the home, school or ballet schoolat which the childrenattended; inabout June 2010, the mother told Dr M, a psychiatrist commissioned to preparereports for use in these proceedings, that: i) she hadinitially been diagnosed as having a psychotic episode secondary todexamphetamine use but, later, a diagnosis of paranoidschizophrenia was made; ii) after she left hospital she refused to take the medication prescribed toher and spat it out when it was given to her in hospital; iii) she managed to get out of hospital because she had worked out shehad to agree with what the staff said and not disagreewith them about theirideas; iv) despite knowing she was supposed to follow up treatment once releasedfrom hospital, she saw a medical practitioner and case manageron one occasioneach only and did not, thereafter, follow up; v) despite her dexamphetamine use having been out ofcontrol[6] before her December2009 admission to hospital, she got herself put back on dexamphetamine byattending on a general practitionerafter her release fromhospital. as atJune 2010, Dr M considered that, while the Mother gave lip serviceto the idea that she had suffered an illness,she did not really believe this tobe the case or that she had been unwell  she simply agreed so there wouldnot be difficultiesabout what he described as her ongoingprobable psychotic ideation; themother was an involuntary in-patient between 2 September 2010 and 10 September2010; despitethere being provision for the children to spend supervised time with the mother,this has occurred on very limited occasionbecause the Contact Centre refused toprovide supervision; themother was a voluntary in-patient in a hospital in northern New South Walesbetween 1 January 2011 and 10 January 2011; themother was admitted on an involuntary in-patient basis in a different hospitalin northern New South Wales between 11 January2011 and about 10 March 2011 butabsconded from the hospital on 14 February 2011; themother has previously been admitted to various mental health facilities in bothQueensland and New South Wales, has previouslybeen subjected to InvoluntaryTreatment Orders on a number of occasions and has also previously absconded fromtreatment; whenshe spoke with Dr M on 23 May 2011, the mother had not seen the two youngestchildren since about July 2010 and had, more recently,seen F when F visited herin hospital in February 2011; Dr Mnoted during the May 2011 interview that the mother: i) became rapidly irritable when questioned about the nature ofher beliefs; ii) placed little or no weight on the fact that medical practitioners hadexpressed the opinion her earlier report of seeing peopleprior to her firstinvoluntary admission might be a symptom of her mental health problems; iii) reported complex and difficult to follow stories regardingrecent issues including the police having hercar as it had been stolenand sold five times; iv) became rapidly irritable when questioned about any eventsto do with sensitive topics like: hospitalisation,psychiatriccare, her previous or current belief systems and access to the children or thefather; v) demonstrated rapidly increasing agitation during the interview and whichwas much more prominent than in his previous interviews; vi) described an ongoing belief in various persecutory delusions; vii) had no insight into her psychiatric condition; viii) said she had only ever gone to hospital because she did not have anymoney and, otherwise, would never have presented for treatment; ix) had no insight into the abnormal nature of her previous and currentbelief systems about potential sexual abuse of the children,people followingand plotting against her and her aunt being a Satanist; x) saw no need for psychiatric treatment and had no insight into the possibledeleterious effects of her ongoing use of dexamphetaminein her condition a matter which had been explained on a number of occasions in bothclinical and Court settings. sometimein the latter half of 2012, the mother thought there was a bomb in her car andexposed G to this belief;[7] she alsoexposed H  who presented to Ms Q as an anxious 8 year old who was scared of her mother because hermother said that there weremonsters attacking their kids  to her belief that thereal moon hadbeen blown up and there was a fake one in thesky; inabout December 2012, the mother posted information, which included theparties eldest daughters name and details,about Satanism andPaedophile rings on the internet; theMother appeared by her guardian, the Adult Guardian - who was appointed by anOrder made by the Queensland Civil and AdministrativeTribunal on 4 November2011 - in the parenting proceedings; themother appears to have moved between Queensland and New South Wales to takeadvantage of the lack of reciprocity in InvoluntaryTreatment Orders such was her determination not to be admitted to hospital consequent upon anInvoluntary Treatment Orderoperative at the time of the trial that she refusedto return to Queensland for the same. Lestit be thought that the possibility of using a Contact Centre to facilitate safeand appropriate time between the children andthe mother has not beenconsidered, I note the Independent Childrens Lawyer sought orders thatthe children spend no timewith the mother, the mother sought that her time withthe children be supervised privately  in a manner which I consider tobeunworkable, impracticable and highly unlikely to be able to be facilitated - andprevious attempts to use such a service havebeen unsuccessful. Whilsta little unusual, perhaps, I consider that the form of Order outlined at thecommencement of these Reasons is the only onecapable of addressing, in apractical sense, the realities of the mothers mental ill-health and itsconsequent impacts onher capacity to interact positively with thechildren. Ifthe father decided, unreasonably, to refuse to permit the children to spend timewith the mother in circumstances where her mentalhealth had improved sosignificantly that she was able to demonstrate stability of functioning, shewill be able to exercise herright as a parent to seek further parenting ordersonce she is able to provide the Court with evidence she has been attending on,and following the recommendations of, a psychiatrist armed with sufficientknowledge of her past difficulties.

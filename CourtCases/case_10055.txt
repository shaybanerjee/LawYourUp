FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA AT MELBOURNE FILE NUMBER:MLC 4917 of 2014 State CentralAuthority Applicant And Ms Barnes Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT Thisis an application by the respondent to adjourn the State CentralAuthoritys application for the reasons that are set outin an affidavitsworn by her on 14 August. It is not necessary for me to make any findingsbased upon that material because theState Central Authority neither opposes norconsents to the arrangement. Clearly, the requesting parent wants the matter onas quicklyas possible and having regard to the age of the baby in this casethat is understandable. Becausethe State Central Authority wants to call some further evidence, it seemslogical that the matter cannot proceed next Mondayand, indeed, if the defencesare as Mr Testart indicates, which are habitual residence and grave risk, thenhe needs have the evidenceavailable to his client and, clearly, that is notgoing to be ready by next Monday. Itis therefore sensible and just to arrange an adjournment and while there hasbeen some discussion about the possibility of thematter being dealt with in twodays, it seems to me that this is a lot more simple than what it looks on itsface, and I would suggestthat it might be more sensible to try and deal with itin one, dealing with as much as we possibly can on the papers and to the extentthat the matter is not resolved on that day, then I would give it a few hourswithin a fortnight or so thereafter. I certify that the precedingthree (3) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of theHonourable Justice Cronin deliveredon 18 August2014.

FAMILY COURT OF AUSTRALIA AT NEWCASTLE FILE NUMBER:(P)NCC962 of 2008 Mr Matthews Applicant And Ms Matthews Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT INTRODUCTION Thisis a dispute over the adjustment of interests in matrimonial property. Theapplicant is the wife (40); the respondent is thehusband (52). Theparties began living together in 2001 and married in 2002. Theyhave two children aged 10 and almost nine. The parties have reached agreementon the parenting arrangements for them. Theylive with their mother and spendtime with their father. Therewere several short periods of estrangement before final separation in March2010. Theonly significant asset is a rural property, run as a farm (the farmproperty). The husband had purchased the propertyin 1999 and was livingand working there when the wife moved to live with him in late 2001. Afterseparation the husband remained living and working on the property. The wifeand children moved to live in a local city. Bothparties have formed new relationships. Bothparties wish to acquire the property as a result of these proceedings. CIRCUMSTANCES AT COHABITATION Theparties began their relationship towards the end of 2001. To the extent thatthere had been a dispute about that, the husbandconceded in his oral evidencethe wifes version of events. Atthe time of commencement of cohabitation, the husband was 39, a widower withfour children, three of whom lived with him. Theywere the three sons of hisfirst marriage, then aged 10, nine and six. Their mother, his first wife, haddied some years previously. His youngest child, then aged five, was thedaughter of a prior de facto relationship. She lived with her mother and spenttimein school holidays with her father during his marriage to the applicantwife. Thewife was working as a technician and salesperson in a local city when she movedto live with the husband and his children. Shewas single, had no children andwas aged 27. Husband injured in accident prior to marriage - Trustestablished InJanuary 1994, almost eight years prior to cohabitation, the husband was involvedin a motor vehicle accident. He suffered multipleinjuries. He was then livingwith his first wife. InDecember 1994 the husband separated from his first wife. In1995 he commenced proceedings and was ultimately awarded $2 million indamages. InSeptember 1998, the M Trust (The Trust) was established to receivethe balance of his personal injury judgment monies. The trustee of that trustwas Perpetual Trustee Limited (the Trust Company). Someof those funds were used in November 1999 for the purchase of the farm property.The purchase price of $425,000, stamp duty andlegal fees were paid from theTrust. In2001 a payment by way of de facto property settlement of $40,000 was paid fromthe trust. Subsequentimprovements to the R property, including the installation of a swimming pooland building of a car port, were funded bythe Trust. Regularpayments of approximately $2,200 per fortnight were paid by the Trust tosupplement farm income. Ad hoc payments were alsomade for such things asschool fees, rates, tax and household bills. In2009 the Trust advised the parties that the fortnightly payments could not besustained.[1] The parties made asubmission for the payments to continue acknowledging that the Trust would runout in four to six years. InApril 2010, the month after separation, the Trust was valued at$233,616.[2] InNovember 2011 the husband received the last fortnightly payment from theTrust. InJune 2013 the final payment of $5,211 was made to the husband leaving the Trustwith a nil balance. HISTORY OF THE LITIGATION OVER PROPERTY On3 September 2012 the wife filed an Initiating Application in the FederalMagistrates Court (as it then was) seeking final orderswhich would have theeffect of liquidating the assets, including the R property, and dispersing thefunds in a ratio of 70/30 inher favour. Interim orders were also sought for anaccounting of livestock, machinery and a restraint on selling same. Itis apparent in retrospect that the husband was profoundly offended by thisapplication and became determined not to cooperate withthe process. The matterunfolded in the following way. On9 November 2012 the wife filed an Application in a Case seeking orders torestrain the husband from dealing with the R property,the breeding stock on theproperty and the equipment and tools owned by a business run by theparties. On19 November 2012 orders were made in the Federal Magistrates Court for aconciliation conference, with directions for progressionof the matter. On16 December 2012 the husband filed his Response proposing final orders asfollows: transfer to the wife of two horses, a motorvehicle, the bulldozer anda truck; with the wife to transfer to the husband her right to any otherproperty. On14 March 2013 the conciliation conference, due to take place in four daystime, was rescheduled to a date in July 2013. At that time it was noted thatthe parties were significantly apart on the value of the rural property, but hada joint intentionto see the property sold with discussion about the percentagedivision of proceeds. The matter was unresolved. On25 July 2013 the proceedings were transferred to this Court. On7 August 2013 orders were made by a Registrar for the provision by the husbandof documents, particularly loan statements in relationto the liability securedon the rural property, and distributions from the Trust. Directions were madefor the appointment of avaluer. On2 October 2013 further directions were made by a Registrar. On13 November 2013 further orders were made by a Registrar, with particularreference to the delivery by the husband of documentsrelating to the Trust,bank statements from the businesses and lists of plant and equipment andlivestock from depreciation schedules,with a fall back provision to the wife toissue subpoena in the event those documents were not produced by the husband. There wasa notation to those orders that the husband was attending to the2011/2012 taxation returns and that a draft set of minutes of consentorderswere in existence. On29 November 2013 the wife filed an Application in a Case seeking a payment toher of $50,000. On18 December 2013 orders were made by a Registrar for the husband to file aResponse to that Application in a Case and other directions. There was anotation to those orders that the wife alleged that the husband had not compliedwith earlier directions to provideparticular documents. On17 January 2014 the wife filed an Amended Application in a Case seeking anincreased payment, that is $100,000, within 21 daysby way of interimproperty settlement with a fall back provision for sale of livestock andthe R property itself. On21 February 2014 the husband filed a Response seeking only dismissal of themothers application. On24 February 2014 orders were made that the husband pay the wife $100,000. On18 March 2014 the husband filed a Notice of Appeal from that order. On20 March 2014 the wife filed an Application in a Case seeking orders that thehusband provide: Fulldisclosure in respect of work performed by him from the date of separation todate; Copiesof relevant bank statements; Invoicesfor works performed by him for third parties; Bankstatements and account details for the Trust; Anaccounting of all pigs sold with a fall-back position that if the husband did not comply, his Response tothe Initiating Application be dismissed and the matterproceed undefended. Therewas an affidavit in support of the Application in a Case by the wifessolicitor setting out in detail the allegationsmade by the wife of pastnon-disclosure by the husband. On26 March 2014 orders were made by consent for provision by the husband oftax invoice books, financial reports, financial statements and taxation returnsand for the wifeto supply to the husband copies of her taxation returns, taxassessment notices and other documents. There were extensive notesto thoseconsent orders, which were effectively the parties arguing their respectivecases through notes. On17 April 2014 the husband was not present at Court. The matter was givenexpedited final hearing dates for two days in July 2014;directions were madeand notations that: thevaluation of plant equipment livestock and motor vehicles was to take placeshortly; and thehusband had failed to comply with particular previous orders. On5 May 2014 the husband filed an Application in a Case seeking a stay of theinterim orders made on 24 February 2014. On9 May 2014 the Application for a stay was dismissed. Costs were awarded to thewife. On27 May 2014 directions were made for payment of hearing fees. On5 June 2014 the husband filed an Application in an Appeal to expedite the appealhearing. That application was granted. On10 June 2014 the Appeal from the interim orders of February 2014 was heard. On19 June 2014 orders were made by the Full Court allowing the appeal by consentand defining the particular items which the wifewas to receive from thehusband. By the conclusion of final hearing, those orders had not been compliedwith. On23 June 2014 the wife filed an Application in a Case seeking to rely on afurther affidavit. On26 June 2014 the husbands solicitors filed a Notice of Ceasing to Act. Also on that day the husband filed his affidavitand financial statement,prepared by that firm of solicitors. Inmy view, the reason for the matter taking almost two years to come to trialrelates largely to delay in disclosure and resistanceto the process by thehusband. Further,despite painstaking cross examination of the husband relying on the documentsavailable, I am not satisfied that the fullfinancial position of the husbandwas revealed. Conduct of the trial On3 July 2014 the two day hearing before me commenced. The husband representedhimself and appeared to find the task difficult andconfronting. Hecross-examined the wife and her witnesses. Thehearing did not conclude within the allocated time and was adjourned for anadditional day on 10 July 2014; also finishing lateon that day. Thestated history reveals the extent to which the focus of the parties, but mostparticularly the husband, was on the litigationitself rather than a resolutionof the dispute between the parties. Cross-examinationconducted by the husband was a revelation of his failure to understand the courtproceedings as a process for resolutionof a legitimate application by the wifeand his own response. Inhis case outline, as one of the orders sought, the husband asked for his ownformer solicitor and the wifes solicitor tobe investigated forwhat they were up to. Inmy view what the lawyers were up to each in their respective roleswas to progress the case to trial though preparationincluding disclosure andanalysis of all relevant documents. Ihave no reason to doubt that the husband was advised of his obligation to makefull financial disclosure to the Court. It is apparentthat the advice was notaccepted. Documents were produced, referred to and offered to be produced rightup to conclusion of hearing. APPROACH TO ALTERATION OF INTERESTS IN PROPERTY Inconsidering applications for alteration of property interests and transfer ofproperty the Court must: (i) Identifythe existing legal and equitable interests of the parties inproperty;[3] (ii) Considerwhether it would be just and equitable in the particular circumstances to makean alteration; (iii) If analteration should be made, to consider the matters contained in s 79(4) ands 75(2) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) (the Act) incoming to an adjustment; and (iv) Analyseand consider whether the adjustment under consideration would be just andequitable. (i) Identify the assets and liabilities of the parties Theinterests in property assets and liabilities of the parties were identified in ajoint Balance Sheet[4] as set outbelow: Oship Description Wifes value Husbands value ASSETS 1 H [R Property] (joint valuation) $700,000.00 $700,000.00 2 H Livestock (joint valuation) $28,815.00 $28,815.00 3 H Plant, Equipment & motor vehicles (joint valuation) $172,700.00 $172,700.00 5 W NAB Acc ...602 as at 28/02/2014 -$232.02 $232.02 6 W [C] Credit Union Acc at 31/12/2013 $75.07 7 H [C] Credit Union Savings Acc ...5S7 at 09/03/2014 $95.98 $95.98 8 H [C] Credit Union cheque at 25/03/2014 $600.80 $600.80 9 H [C] Credit Union Acc no. ...7S7 Business Access at 25/03/2014 $236.45 $236.45 10 W Mazda [motor vehicle] Est $1,000.00 11 H Household contents Est $7,000.00 $1,500.00 12 W Household contents Est $1,000.00 13 W Cameras & equipment Est $1,500.00 Total $912,791.28 ADDBACKS AND WASTAGE 14 H Livestock $216,185.00 15 H [R Property] $300,000.00 18 H Trust Investment $220,000.00 Total $736,180.00 LIABILITIES 19 H NAB Loan Account No. ...991 (Mortgage) $300,000.00 $300,000.00 20 H NAB Vida Credit Card account ending in 178 at 21/03/2014 $24,259.16 $24,259.16 21 H Country Energy Unknown 22 W [Mr and Mrs T] (personal loan) Est $4,000.00 23 W NAB Credit Card as at 04/02/2014 $4,874.19 24 H NAB Farm Management acc no. ...281 as at 24/03/2014 $19,443.53 $19,443.53 25 H [C] Account ...S38 at 25/03/2014 $8,273.39 $8,273.39 26 H Utilities and rates $27,716.92 Unknown Total $360,850.27 SUPERANNUATION 27 W AMP Accumulation (as at 30/06/2013) $2,427.34 28 W AMP Accumulation (as at 11/10/2013) $840.00 29 W One Path/ Integra Accumulation (as at 30/06/2013) $1,911.18 30 W ING Ausfund Accumulation (as at 30/06/2013) $51.99 Total $5,230.51 Total value of Assets including Wastage and Addbacks $1,654,201.80 Net value of Assets including Wastage and Addbacks $1,293,351.60 Total value of Assets excluding Wastage and Addbacks $918,021.79 Net value of Assets excluding Wastage and Addbacks $557,171.52 ANALYSIS OF ASSET POOL Items excluded ByItems 14,15 and 18 the wife identifies three areas under the headingAddbacks and Wastage which I have excluded from the asset poolbut are matters to be taken into account in considering contributions and theoverall adjustment of interests. Items21 and 26 are deleted being unknown. Items22 and 23 for the wife are excluded from the asset pool as personal debtsacquired since separation, Item20 for the husband is excluded from the asset pool as a personal credit carddebt acquired since separation. Thenet interests of each of the parties in the net asset pool are: (a) Thehusband: Assets Item 1 [R property] $700,000.00 Item 2 Livestock $28,815.00 Item 3 Plant equipment and motor vehicles $172,200.00 Items 7, 8, 9 Credit Union $933.00 Item 11 Household contents (husbands est) $1,500.00 Total $903,448.00 Liabilities Item 19 NAB Mortgage $300,000.00 Items 24& 25 Debt to Bank / Credit Union $27,716.00 Total $327,716.00 Net total $575,732.00 (b) The wife: Assets Items 5, 6 Accounts $307.00 Item 10 Mazda [motor vehicle] $1,000.00 Item 12 Household contents $1,000.00 Item 13 Camera equipment $1,500.00 Items 27-30 Superannuation $5,230.00 Total $9,037.00 Combined net total $584,769.00 (ii) Would it be just and equitable to make analteration? Atpresent the husband has the sole legal interest in the most significant asset ofthe parties the farm property. He lives on theproperty. He has also retained,sold and used stock and equipment. The husband disposed of assets, including thebalance of his TrustFunds. He has had an inheritance whilst living and workingon the farm property. Hehad not, by the conclusion of hearing, complied with interim orders for paymentto the wife made in this Court nor the orders subsequentlymade by the FullCourt. Therewere eight years of marriage and the birth of two children. For four and a halfyears post separation the wife has had theprimary responsibility for the careand financial support of those children whilst living in rented accommodationand working intown. Thewife retained minimal assets post separation Inmy view it is both just and equitable to consider an alteration of interests toreflect past contributions and future needs. (iii) Consideration of matters contained in s 79(4) and s 75(2)in coming to an adjustment Initial contributions In2001 the respective financial positions of the parties was as follows. Thewife had a car, some furnishings, minimal savings and about $2,500 in creditcard debt. Thehusband had the R property, a herd of commercial cattle, some registered studcattle, farm vehicles, tools and farm supplies,funds in the Trust (probablyabout $1million), minimal savings and debts on an overdraft account and creditcards. Clearlythe initial financial position of the husband was vastly stronger than that ofthe wife. Further, his farm property provideda home for both parties and theirchildren, as each was born, and as such, should be acknowledged as a significantcontribution byhim.[5] (iv) Contributions during the marriage Duringthe marriage the parties both made a variety of contributions; financial,non-financial and towards the welfare of the family. The wife Consensually,the wife reduced her hours of paid work, and then after marriage, left her job.She had been earning about $21,000 perannum. She did so at the request of thehusband mainly to care for his four children. Her fulltime presence at home hada secondarybenefit of freeing up the husband to do paid work offfarm. Howeverwillingly and affectionately undertaken, the care of the children was no smalltask. The mother of the three boys had diedin 1996 by suicide. She had beenthe driver of the vehicle in the accident in 1994 from which the husbandreceived his injuries. They separated within a year of that accident. At thedate of her death the boys were aged five, four and a one year old. Thesecondboy is disabled by cerebral palsy. He was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2009. InMarch 1996 the husband formed a new household when he began living with his defacto partner, she being pregnant at the date oftheir commencing cohabitation.Three months later the child was born and three weeks after her birth theboys mother died. The three boys then came to live with their father,his de facto partner and the new baby. InJanuary 2001 the husband and his de facto partner separated, she moving awaywith their daughter then aged about four and a halfyears. Accordingly,later in that year when the wife came into the lives of the three boys, by thenaged 10, nine and six, she was theirthird mother figure. They had sufferedmultiple disruptions to their lives and must have benefited from the loving careand attentionprovided by their young step-mother over the following eight plusyears. Copies of letters, messages, Mothers Day cards andschool relateddocuments put into evidence by the wife support thatconclusion.[6] Thefourth child of the husband came for school holidays throughout the relationshipand was cared for and supervised by the wifealong with the other children. Themaintenance of the relationship of the four siblings with each other was animportant matter. In2004 and 2005 the parties two children were born. The wife provided mostof their care and supervision and has continuedto do so since separation. Iregard this contribution by the wife to the welfare of the husband, his fourchildren plus their owntwo children as highly significant. There was noacknowledgment by the husband of the special efforts of the wife in respect ofthesix children, but her role as primary carer was not disputed. Other contributions Thewife took care of the financial running of the farm and was responsible for themajority of book-keeping and bill paying. Shewas the point of reference forthe accountant. Thewife prepared and delivered meals for farm workers who lived and/or worked onthe farm. Thewife supported further education for the husband, helping him with assignmentsand research and taking up extra work on the farmand with the children while hestudied. Attimes the wife, together with the farm hand, managed day to day operations ofthe farm when the husband worked away from the farm. Thewife was the instigator of the development of a breeding program to increase thevalue of the stud cattle. Her father, who alsohad a breeding business, providedadvice and guidance to the parties. Thewife undertook the majority of gardening and yard work. She maintained the fruittrees. The husband Therewere three sources of income during the period of the marriage. Firstly, fromthe cattle stud; secondly, from a business hiringout farm equipment; andthirdly, from payments made from the Trust. Thehusband was responsible for the financial contributions. He worked hard on andoff the farm and ran the business. He was alsothe beneficiary, at his request,of Trust payments which supported the family when the other two sources ofincome were unprofitable. In2009 at the instigation of the wife, the parties sought advice from the RuralFinancial Counselling Service of NSW. At varioustimes the farm was affected bydrought and flood. Thefinancial position of the farm property deteriorated sharply afterseparation. The stud breeding program In2003/04 the husband borrowed $250,000 from a Credit Union to invest in thedevelopment of the genetic breeding program. The developmentof stud cattle bya genetic breeding program ultimately failed and the parties lost money. Theparties agree about that outcomebut identify different causes. It is difficultto determine when efforts in that regard ceased. Thewife asserts that it was a combination of bad luck, poor timing and a failure bythe husband to implement the advice given byher father and to stay patient. She would like to acquire the remaining genetic material. The husband assertsthat it was pooradvice and a lack of transparency around sales by thewifes father. Cross-examinationby the husband of his father-in-law revealed that the husband blamed both hiswife and his father-in-law for thefailure of the breeding program, which hadbeen undertaken by the husband and wife with support, assistance and advice frommaternalfamily members. In2007/08 more money was borrowed, about $500,000. The Credit Union loan wasrefinanced and the balance used for the purchase ofequipment for a businesswhich leased equipment and carried out work on local farms. InOctober 2010, six months after separation, the parties rural financialcounsellor reported on the financial analysis undertakenby him to the TrustCompany.[7] He referred to thehusband having reached a stage where he was well placed to produce quality studcattle with little further investment. The counsellor advocated strongly forthe release of the balance of the Trust to enable the husband to clear debts andthereafteraccess drought/flood subsidies and income support. This letter doesnot support the husbands assertion of obvious lack ofprofitability ofthe breeding program by late 2004/05. Iformed the conclusion that the husband had been able to commence the studbreeding program with the support and assistance bothof his wife, who undertook all of the administrative side of the development of the stud, and hisfather-in-law, who gave him thepractical day to day advice and shared resourceswith him. However after the marriage broke down, the husband was unwilling orunableto continue alone and subsequently sold off cattle, which could have hada much higher value in the breeding program if it had continued. He retains thegenetic material. Atthe conclusion of the marriage, the financial contributions favoured thehusband, but the non-financial contributions of the wifewere at least equal tothose of the husband and certainly exceeded his in relation to the welfare ofthe family. Anadjustment of interests in favour of the wife to create a ratio of 60/40 infavour of the husband is justified. Post separation Therehave been four and a half years, post separation, where the wife has had primaryresponsibility for the care supervision andfinancial support of the childrenwhilst paying for rented accommodation. The children are now 10 and almost nineyears. She hasa partner who shares some expenses. The wife lives on herfathers property with the children. Thehusband has had the benefit of living on the R property which has an overallmarket rental value of $650 perweek.[8] He has apparently collectedrent from a smaller residence on the property. He pays a low level of childsupport of $25 per week. The Bank mortgage Thehusband disclosed in his financial statement est $482 mortgagepayments in respect of the loan secured by mortgage.The mortgage debt has notreduced since 2012. Thehusband had not taken the task of completing this document seriously. TheFinancial Summary (part B) reflects his attitude. Nilor TBA was the answer toall but one line. The income figures in Part O were all estimates. I could notrely on this document tounderstand the financial position of the husband,including mortgage payments. The Inheritance In2012 the husband inherited $306,000 from a relative. He reduced the bank loanfrom $500,000 to $300,000 and paid off other debts.That was a benefit to bothparties. However, I have concluded that the significance of that contributionis overshadowed by othermatters. Livestock (Item 14 on Balance Sheet) Thehusband sold livestock and equipment. He agists cattle and raises and sellspigs. The husband did not advise the wife of thefinancial details. Exhibits 8and 9 are schedules of information extracted by cross-examination of thehusband. They reflect moreincome than was disclosed. Therewas inadequate disclosure of income by the husband but what was disclosedgreatly exceeds the income of the wife. However thebenefit of that income, tothe parties jointly, relates only to the reduction in the mortgage. There wereno contributions to thewife or the children, from the two sources of cash fundsavailable to the husband, namely the balance of inheritance and the balanceofTrust funds. There was no further reduction of the mortgage by loanrepayments. Trust funds (Item 18 on Balance Sheet) Betweenseparation and hearing, $233,316 of Trust funds was received and dispersed bythe husband . Decline in value of farm property (Item 15 on BalanceSheet) Thevalue of the property has apparently diminished from where it sat during themarriage. Financialposition statements[9] by the husbandto the bank reflected a rise in value of the farm property between 2008 and 2011to $1.2 million. The wife says andI accept that there was conversation priorto separation where the husband spoke to her of his pride and pleasure in theachievementof this increase from the purchase price in 1999 of $450,000. Ihave not included any figure in the asset pool to reflect the drop in value to$700,000. There is no relevant valuation for earlierdates and if there wereevidence, it would be required to attribute the reduction to waste as was soughtby the wife. Howeverthe fall in value is consistent with the observations of the wifes unclewho provided a late affidavit; admitted intoevidence on a limited basis and notas a valuation.[10] He is a stockand station agent and was present when stock and equipment valuations wereundertaken on the property. During cross-examinationby the husband hecommented that the property had a good fertiliser history but no longer. It wasdescribed as being in atired and neglected state; weeds had taken over,there had been no regular mulching and weed control. Thehusband asked the witness why he thought the value had diminished. The answerwas decisive: Lack of maintenance. Farmingis a seven day a weekjob. He went on to spell out in detail what needed to be done. Itake this evidence into account in concluding that it is less likely that thehusband applied his trust funds, inheritance money,or proceeds of sale of stockto routine maintenance on the property. Asa result, there remains uncertainty over the use of those funds. Full Courtauthority supports the proposition that the husbandcannot rely on absence ofevidence to prevent the making oforders.[11] Further,the inference arises that the husband, given his attitude to disclosure, allowedthe farm property to run down deliberatelyfor the purpose of theseproceedings. Takingall these matters into account I consider that despite the contribution of partof his inheritance to the reduction of themortgage, there should be a slightadjustment in favour of the wife. Thereshould be a further adjustment based on the contribution of the wife during thisperiod to create a ratio of 55/45 in favourof the husband. (iii) Relevant s 75(2) factors for adjustment Ofthe factors in s 75(2) to be taken into consideration pursuant to a 79(4)(e), Inote the following relevant matters. (a) Age and state of health Thewife is aged 40 and described herself as fit and healthy. Thehusband is 52. He set out various aspects of his state of health including painin several parts of his body and a condition,stated to be prolapsed bowel, forwhich he will undergo gastroscopy on or before March 2015 and may requiresurgery.[12] InOctober 2010 the husband had an accident causing a fracture in his spine. Hewas unable to work for a period of weeks. The husbandalso referred to memoryand cognition problems as a result of the head injuries Isuffered. Iam unable to determine to what extent, if any, the injuries that the husbandsuffered in 1994 and 2010 affect his ability to function. The only medicalevidence put before me was that of Dr L, the husbands generalpractitioner. Dr L provided a report whichset out the husbands physicalinjuries from the accident and the ongoingconsequences:[13] He islikely to experience exacerbation of his pain with heavy lifting, long periodsof sitting and driving heavy vehicles due tothe vibrations, or with any heavyphysical work. Due to his head injury he is probably only suitable to thefarming work he doesnow as he finds he has trouble with recall and memory anddoes not function well when under pressure. This likely relates back tohishead injury. I think his past injuries thus severely limit his ability to seekemployment with any employer. DrL was cross-examined. She stated that she was unsure of the exact date of themotor vehicle accident suffered by the husband. No criticism was made of Dr L,nor should there have been. The doctor conceded that her report was aprognosis; that she had beenasked about capacity for employment and was not aspecialist. The husband has not sought referrals and she had not referred himfor further testing, Youd have to have an occupational therapistdo a current assessment. DrL also very properly conceded that she had included in her report what she hadlearned from conversations with the husband duringhis regular visits to her,and quickly agreed that the Court could not rely on what she had said todetermine the actual ability of the husband to work in the future, as opposed tobeing employed in thefuture: If I was the one who was to make thatdecision, I would require testing. Thehusband referred, during the course of the hearing, to raising funds by the saleof cattle to pay specialists who would conductsuch assessments on him for theseproceedings, but ultimately no such evidence was put before the Court. Thehusband purchased the R property after the motor vehicle accident and has workedon it since. He expressed a strong wish duringthe course of these proceedings,and by his orders sought, to continue to do so. Itherefore conclude in the absence of medical evidence otherwise, that thehusband has the capacity to continue to work as a farmerin the way he does now. (b) Income, property and financial resources of each ofthe parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them forappropriategainful employment Theincome of the husband is not less than $1,050 per week and may be more. Thedisclosure in his financial statement was inadequate. He has the mentalcapacity to continue with gainful employment. There is some physicalrestriction from accidents in 1994 and 2010. The husband has continued to runthe property as a farm from 1999, when it was purchased, to date. Thewife has the physical and mental capacity for gainful employment. She was asales person before she met the husband and gaveup work. She is a visualartist and has relevant equipment. She occasionally sells her work through abusiness owned and run byher new partner; that business may be able to bedeveloped in the future when the children are older. (c) Care and control of a child under the age of 18years Thewife has the care and control of the parties two children, aged 10 andalmost nine. They spend time with their fatherat weekends and holidays, butthe mother is responsible for their education, supervision and extra-curricularactivities, not onlyin terms of time, but also financially. Thefathers four children from previous relationships are all now adults. (d) Commitments of each of the parties that are necessaryto enable the party to support himself, herself or a child Notapplicable. (e) Responsibility of either party to support any otherperson Thefather has a partner with three children who have come to live with him on the Rproperty. He has not disclosed any income earnedby that new partner; nor anychild support paid to her by the father of those children. I do not take hisfinancial commitmentsin that regard, if there are any, into account. (f) Eligibility for a pension allowance orbenefit In2011 Dr L wrote a letter in support of an application by the husband for amedical support pension, expressing the view that hewas likely to significantlyimprove over the next two years. The husband has not been referred to anyspecialist. Accordingly,I have no specialist evidence on the husbands capacity to do physicalwork and also to do the administrative sideof farming, requiring organisationalskills. I have no reason to doubt that the husband has had the physical problemwith his kneeand back that were described by his general practitioner, but I amunable to discern the impact of the head injury, including a cerebralhaemorrhage 20 years ago, or the spinal injury four years ago. (g) Standard of living that in all the circumstances isreasonable Theparties spent their marriage on the R property, living a rural lifestyle withtheir children. There was stability of accommodation,which the husband hasmaintained. Thewife has obtained rental accommodation and would prefer to purchase a propertyfor herself and the children to live in. (h) The duration of the marriage and the extent to whichit has affected the earning capacity of either party Themarriage endured for approximately eight and a half years, including a period ofcohabitation. The wife gave up her paid employmentwhen she married thehusband. She had been contemplating a visual arts business for herself and Iaccept that she feels deskilledby changes in that field over the last 10years. Thepresence of the wife in the family caring for up to six children, four of whomare the husbands by two previous relationships,had the effect ofreleasing him to do paid work off the farm and income producing work on theproperty. (i) The need to protect a party who wishes to continue therole as a parent Theparties have agreed on arrangements for the children, which commit the wife tobeing available to supervise the children beforeand after school and in holidaytimes. Both parents wish to continue their role as parents. (j) If either party is cohabitating with anotherperson Thewife is living in accommodation on her fathers property, paying rent asshe can. She is living with the children only. She may live with her partnerin the future. Thehusband apparently has his new partner living with him on theproperty. Superannuation/Commonwealth Benefits Thewife has superannuation in four plans with a total value of $5,230. Shereceives the Family Tax Benefit and Newstart by way ofGovernment benefits. Thehusband disclosed no superannuation interests. An adjustment for future needs Thewife is 12 years younger than the husband and has the capacity to work for alonger period. That capacity is restricted by herneed to care for and supervisethe children around school hours and holiday times over the next nineyears. Thehusband may continue to do farm work as he has done for the last 15 years. Hemay also continue to do contract work off farm.He can earn income from theproperty though rental of the other residence, stock agistment and hispiggery. Eachof the parties have new partners. The husbands partner, about whom heprovided no information other than her name, apparentlylives and works on thefarm, as do her children. Withparticular reference to care and control of the children I consider that anadjustment in favour of the wife is appropriate tocreate a ratio of 60/40 inthe wifes favour. (iv) Is the adjustment of interests under consideration justand equitable? Bothparties proposed acquisition of the rural property. Thewife has not lived on the farm for four and a half years. The wife asserts thatshe could borrow from her family to pay out thehusbands interest in theproperty. That may be so. There was no specific evidence on that point,particularly her capacityto repay a loan, sufficient to justify provision forthe wife to acquire the property. Thehusband had owned and worked on the property for at least two years when hebegan living with the wife. He has remained livingand working there afterseparation. Itis appropriate in my view for the husband to be given the opportunity to retainthe property by making a cash payment to the wife. Toeffect this adjustment, the farm property will probably be refinanced to providefor the payment to the wife. Ordersare made in the alternative for retention or sale. Theoutcome may be that the husband retains the farm property with a greatlyincreased mortgage. In the alternative, the farm propertymay be sold andconsequentially the stock and equipment. That would leave the husband probablyrenting accommodation, debt free witha fund for contingencies after payment ofhis credit card debt[14] and legalcosts in the sum of $60,655.[15] Whichevercourse is taken by the husband, the wife will have a cash sum to contribute toaccommodation for herself and the childrenafter payment of her personaldebts.[16] She also has outstandinglegal costs in the sum of$107,883.[17] Itis in my view just and equitable for the husband to have the opportunity tocontinue to live and work on the farm, or for the propertyto be sold if thehusband feels unable to take on further debt to pay out the equitable interestof the wife. Itake into account that both parties recognised in March 2013 that the propertywould have to be sold. It does seem the most likelyoutcome. However thehusband should have the opportunity to keep the property if he wishes to do soand is able to finance the cashadjustment required. Ordersare made accordingly with either a cash sum ($341,824) representing theidentified division of assets less the value of assetsretained by the wife, ora percentage of the net proceeds of sale in the ratio of the wifesinterest in the equity of thefarm property (85 per cent).
